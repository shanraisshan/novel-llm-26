## Consensus Score
100% (5/5 correct)

## Analysis
All five agents arrived at the correct answer of 98 years old using identical reasoning:

1. When the brother was 4 years old, the speaker was half his age (4 / 2 = 2 years old)
2. This establishes a constant age difference of 2 years (brother is always 2 years older)
3. Now that the brother is 100 years old, the speaker is 100 - 2 = 98 years old

This is a classic age riddle that tests whether the solver understands that age differences remain constant over time, even though the ratio of ages changes. All agents correctly identified the key insight: being "half his age" at one point in time does not mean you will always be half his age - it simply establishes the fixed age gap between siblings.

The unanimous consensus demonstrates clear understanding of the mathematical relationship.
