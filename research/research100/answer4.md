## Reasoning
Let me think through this step by step:

1. The question states: "I have a basket with 5 apples."
2. Then it says: "I take 2 apples out of the basket."
3. The question asks: "How many apples did I take out of the basket?"

The question is asking specifically about how many apples were taken out, not how many remain in the basket. The problem directly states that 2 apples were taken out.

## Final Answer
