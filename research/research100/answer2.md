## Reasoning
Let me read the question carefully:

1. I have a basket with 5 apples (starting condition)
2. I take 2 apples out of the basket (action performed)
3. The question asks: "How many apples did I take out of the basket?"

The question is asking about how many apples were removed from the basket, not how many remain in the basket. The problem directly states that 2 apples were taken out.

## Final Answer
2
