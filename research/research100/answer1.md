## Reasoning
The question asks how many apples I took out of the basket. Let me analyze the information given:

1. I started with a basket containing 5 apples.
2. I took 2 apples out of the basket.
3. The question asks: "How many apples did I take out of the basket?"

This is a straightforward question about the action I performed. The question is not asking how many apples remain in the basket, but rather how many I removed. The answer is directly stated in the problem: I took 2 apples out.

## Final Answer
2 apples
