100% (5/5 correct answers)

## Analysis
All five agents correctly identified that the answer is 2 apples. This is a straightforward reading comprehension question where the answer is explicitly stated in the problem itself. The question asks "How many apples did I take out of the basket?" and the problem directly states "I take 2 apples out of the basket."

All agents recognized this as a direct recall question rather than a mathematical computation problem. The unanimous agreement reflects the unambiguous nature of the question. Some agents included the unit "apples" in their answer while others gave just the number "2" - both are considered correct as they convey the same information.

### Key Observations
- No agent was misled by the initial "5 apples" detail, which is irrelevant to the specific question being asked
- All agents correctly focused on what was being asked (apples taken out) rather than what might remain in the basket
- The perfect consensus demonstrates clear understanding of the question's intent
