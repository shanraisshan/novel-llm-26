## Reasoning
The question asks how many apples I took out of the basket. Let me read the problem carefully:

1. I start with a basket containing 5 apples
2. I take 2 apples out of the basket
3. The question asks: "How many apples did I take out of the basket?"

The question is directly asking about the number of apples removed from the basket, which is explicitly stated in the problem as 2 apples.

## Final Answer
