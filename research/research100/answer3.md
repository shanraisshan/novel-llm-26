## Reasoning
Let me think through this step by step:

1. The question states: "I have a basket with 5 apples."
2. Then it says: "I take 2 apples out of the basket."
3. The question asks: "How many apples did I take out of the basket?"

The question is directly asking about the action that was just described - taking apples out. The question explicitly states that 2 apples were taken out of the basket.

This is a straightforward reading comprehension question. The answer is given directly in the problem statement.

## Final Answer
2 apples
