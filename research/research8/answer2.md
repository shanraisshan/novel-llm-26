# Answer 2

**Question**: A mother has 4 daughters. Each daughter has 1 brother. The brother has no sisters. How many children does the mother have?

**Response**:

This is a trick question with a logical contradiction.

Let me work through it:
- The mother has 4 daughters
- Each daughter has 1 brother - this means there's 1 son (the same brother shared by all 4 daughters)
- But then it says "the brother has no sisters"

This is impossible. If the brother is the son of the same mother who has 4 daughters, then the brother DOES have sisters - he has 4 of them.

The puzzle as stated contains a contradiction and has no valid answer.

However, if we ignore the contradiction and just count the children mentioned: the mother would have **5 children** (4 daughters + 1 son).

**Final Answer**: Contradiction detected / 5 if ignoring contradiction
