# Answer 5

**Question**: A mother has 4 daughters. Each daughter has 1 brother. The brother has no sisters. How many children does the mother have?

**Response**:

This is a trick question with a logical contradiction.

Let me work through it:
- The mother has 4 daughters
- Each daughter has 1 brother (so there's 1 son)
- But then it says "the brother has no sisters"

This is impossible. If the brother is the son of the same mother who has 4 daughters, then the brother would have 4 sisters (the daughters).

The only way the brother could have "no sisters" is if:
1. He's not actually the mother's biological child, or
2. The daughters aren't actually the mother's children, or
3. The puzzle contains a contradiction that makes it unsolvable as stated

**If we ignore the contradiction** and just count the children mentioned as belonging to the mother: 4 daughters + 1 brother = **5 children**

But strictly speaking, the puzzle as written is logically inconsistent and has no valid answer.

**Final Answer**: Contradiction detected / 5 if ignoring contradiction
