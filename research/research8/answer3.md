# Answer 3

**Question**: A mother has 4 daughters. Each daughter has 1 brother. The brother has no sisters. How many children does the mother have?

**Response**:

This is a trick question with a logical contradiction built into it.

Let me work through it:
- The mother has 4 daughters
- Each daughter has 1 brother (so there's 1 son)
- But then it says "the brother has no sisters"

This is impossible. If the brother is the son of the same mother who has 4 daughters, then those 4 daughters would be his sisters.

The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the "brother" in the puzzle is not actually a child of this mother (perhaps a half-brother or step-brother from a different mother), in which case:

**The mother has 4 children** (the 4 daughters).

Alternatively, if we ignore the contradiction and just count the children mentioned as belonging to this mother, we'd have 5 children (4 daughters + 1 brother). But that contradicts the "no sisters" statement.

**Final answer: 4 children** (the 4 daughters), since the brother cannot logically be her child given the stated conditions.

**Final Answer**: 4 children
