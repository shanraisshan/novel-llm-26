# Answer 4

**Question**: A mother has 4 daughters. Each daughter has 1 brother. The brother has no sisters. How many children does the mother have?

**Response**:

This is a trick question with a contradiction built into it.

Let me work through it:
- The mother has 4 daughters
- Each daughter has 1 brother (so there's 1 son)
- But then it says "the brother has no sisters"

This is impossible. If the brother is a child of the same mother, and the mother has 4 daughters, then the brother would have 4 sisters.

The only way the brother could have "no sisters" is if he's not actually related to the daughters (different mother, step-sibling, etc.), but that contradicts "each daughter has 1 brother."

**If we ignore the contradiction** and just count the children the mother has: 4 daughters + 1 brother = **5 children**

**If we take the contradiction literally** (the brother has no sisters), then there's no valid answer because the scenario is logically impossible.

**Final Answer**: Contradiction detected / 5 if ignoring contradiction
