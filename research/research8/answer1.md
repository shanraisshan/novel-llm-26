# Answer 1

**Question**: A mother has 4 daughters. Each daughter has 1 brother. The brother has no sisters. How many children does the mother have?

**Response**:

This is a trick question with a contradiction built into it.

Let me work through it:
- The mother has 4 daughters
- Each daughter has 1 brother (so there's 1 son)
- But then it says "the brother has no sisters"

This is impossible. If the brother is the son of the same mother who has 4 daughters, then those 4 daughters would be his sisters.

The only way "the brother has no sisters" could be true is if:
1. The brother is from a different family entirely, or
2. The 4 daughters don't exist

If we take the puzzle at face value and assume it's meant to be solvable, the answer would be **5 children** (4 daughters + 1 brother) - ignoring the contradictory statement about the brother having no sisters.

But strictly speaking, **the question contains a logical contradiction and has no valid answer**.

**Final Answer**: Contradiction detected / 5 if ignoring contradiction
