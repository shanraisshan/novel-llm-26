## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question exactly two syllables long? Answer yes or no."

I need to determine which answer (yes or no) is self-consistent:

1. Count the syllables in each possible answer:
   - "yes" = 1 syllable
   - "no" = 1 syllable

2. Check each answer for consistency:
   - If I answer "yes" (1 syllable): I would be claiming my answer IS exactly two syllables long. But "yes" has only 1 syllable. This is false and inconsistent.
   - If I answer "no" (1 syllable): I would be claiming my answer is NOT exactly two syllables long. Since "no" has only 1 syllable, this statement is true and consistent.

3. The only self-consistent answer is "no" because it correctly describes itself - "no" is indeed not two syllables long.

## Final Answer

no
