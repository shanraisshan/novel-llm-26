## Reasoning
The question asks whether my answer is exactly two syllables long, and I must respond with either "yes" or "no."

Let me count the syllables in each possible answer:
- "Yes" = 1 syllable
- "No" = 1 syllable

Neither possible answer has exactly two syllables. Both have only one syllable.

If I answer "yes," I would be claiming my answer has two syllables, but "yes" has only one syllable. This would be false.

If I answer "no," I would be claiming my answer does NOT have two syllables, and since "no" has only one syllable, this statement would be true.

## Final Answer
No
