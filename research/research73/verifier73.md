# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
"Is your answer to this question exactly two syllables long? Answer yes or no."

## Correct Answer
"No"

## Answer Extraction
- Answer 1: No - CORRECT
- Answer 2: no - CORRECT
- Answer 3: No - CORRECT
- Answer 4: No - CORRECT
- Answer 5: No - CORRECT

## Consensus Analysis

All five answers arrived at the same conclusion: "No"

### Areas of Agreement
- All agents correctly identified that both "yes" and "no" have only 1 syllable each
- All agents recognized that answering "no" creates a true, self-consistent statement
- All agents understood that "no" (1 syllable) correctly claims the answer is NOT two syllables long
- The reasoning across all answers was virtually identical and logically sound

### Areas of Disagreement
None. There was complete consensus on both the answer and the underlying reasoning.

### Quality Assessment
All five answers demonstrated strong logical analysis:
- Each agent properly analyzed the self-referential nature of the question
- Each agent checked both possible answers ("yes" and "no") for consistency
- Each agent verified that "no" is the only self-consistent answer since it has 1 syllable (not 2), making the claim true

## Final Synthesized Answer

The correct answer is **"No"**.

This is a self-referential question that requires the answer to be consistent with its own claim. Since both "yes" (1 syllable) and "no" (1 syllable) have only one syllable:
- Answering "yes" would falsely claim the answer has 2 syllables (contradiction)
- Answering "no" truthfully claims the answer does NOT have 2 syllables (consistent)

Therefore, "no" is the only logically consistent answer.

## Final Score
**Consensus Score: 100%**
(5 out of 5 answers matched the correct answer)

## Confidence Assessment
- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score**: 100%
- **Reliability Notes**: Perfect consensus with identical reasoning across all agents. This is a straightforward logical puzzle with a clear, verifiable answer.
