## Reasoning
The question asks whether my answer is exactly two syllables long, and I must respond with either "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze each possible answer:
- "Yes" has 1 syllable
- "No" has 1 syllable

Now I need to determine which answer is truthful:
- If I answer "yes" (1 syllable), I would be claiming my answer has 2 syllables. But "yes" only has 1 syllable, so this would be a false statement.
- If I answer "no" (1 syllable), I would be claiming my answer does NOT have 2 syllables. Since "no" has only 1 syllable, this statement is true.

Therefore, the correct and truthful answer is "no" because my one-syllable answer is indeed not exactly two syllables long.

## Final Answer
No
