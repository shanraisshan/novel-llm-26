# Answer 3

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: The question asks whether my response can be summarized as a single affirmative or negative word. By answering "yes" or "no," I am providing exactly that - a response that is itself a single affirmative or negative word. So "yes" is accurate: my response can indeed be summarized as a single word (and in fact, it is that single word).
