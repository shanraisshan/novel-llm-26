## Analysis
All 5 agents independently arrived at the same answer ("Yes") with consistent reasoning. This is a self-referential question where the act of answering "yes" or "no" validates the truth of the statement. Each agent correctly recognized that:

1. The question asks whether the response can be summarized as a single affirmative or negative word
2. By answering "yes" or "no," the response IS a single affirmative or negative word
3. This makes "yes" the correct and self-consistent answer

The unanimous agreement demonstrates that this is a straightforward logical puzzle with a clear, unambiguous solution. The question is designed so that answering "yes" makes the statement true (the response is indeed a single affirmative word), creating a self-validating logical structure.
