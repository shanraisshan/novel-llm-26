# Answer 1

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: The question asks whether my response can be summarized as a single affirmative or negative word. By answering "yes" or "no," my response is indeed a single affirmative or negative word, making the answer self-consistently "yes." This is a self-referential question where answering "yes" makes the statement true - my response (yes) is itself a single affirmative word.
