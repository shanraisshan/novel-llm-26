## Reasoning

The question states: "I have a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G."

This sentence is describing the piano by listing the labels on its white keys. The labels given are:
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F
7. G

That is 7 distinct labels listed.

The question asks "How many white keys does my piano have?" Based on the description provided, the piano has white keys with these 7 labels. The question is telling us what labels exist on THIS particular piano's white keys.

While a standard full-size piano has 52 white keys (with the pattern A-G repeating across multiple octaves), the question is specifically describing a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G - exactly 7 labels, suggesting 7 white keys.

## Final Answer

7
