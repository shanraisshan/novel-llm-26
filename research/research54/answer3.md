## Reasoning

The question describes a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.

Let me count the labels explicitly listed:
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F
7. G

The question specifically states the piano has white keys labeled with these seven letters. It does not mention multiple octaves or any additional keys beyond those labeled with these seven letters.

Based on the information provided in the question, this piano has exactly 7 white keys (one for each letter A through G).

## Final Answer

7
