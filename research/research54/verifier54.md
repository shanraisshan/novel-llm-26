# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
"I have a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. How many white keys does my piano have?"

**Expected Answer**: 7

## Summary
All 5 agents correctly identified that the question explicitly lists 7 white key labels (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) and concluded that the piano has 7 white keys. Each agent demonstrated careful reading of the question and provided clear reasoning for their answer. Several agents noted the distinction between this specific piano (with 7 white keys) versus a standard full-size piano (which has 52 white keys), but correctly focused on what the question explicitly described.

## Individual Answers

| Agent | Final Answer | Correct? |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | 7 | Yes |
| 2 | 7 | Yes |
| 3 | 7 | Yes |
| 4 | 7 | Yes |
| 5 | 7 | Yes |

### Answer 1
- **Core Conclusion**: 7 white keys
- **Key Evidence**: Counted each letter explicitly (A through G = 7 keys)
- **Unique Insights**: Emphasized that the question does not mention multiple octaves or repetition

### Answer 2
- **Core Conclusion**: 7 white keys
- **Key Evidence**: Listed all 7 labels and counted them systematically
- **Unique Insights**: Acknowledged that a standard piano has 52 white keys but the question describes only 7 labels

### Answer 3
- **Core Conclusion**: 7 white keys
- **Key Evidence**: Counted each letter A through G
- **Unique Insights**: Noted the question does not mention multiple octaves or additional keys

### Answer 4
- **Core Conclusion**: 7 white keys
- **Key Evidence**: Systematic counting of 7 distinct labels
- **Unique Insights**: Referenced standard piano comparison (52 white keys) but correctly focused on question's description

### Answer 5
- **Core Conclusion**: 7 white keys
- **Key Evidence**: Counted all 7 letters listed in the question
- **Unique Insights**: Suggested this could be a small keyboard or toy piano with only one octave

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
- All 5 agents agreed on the answer: **7 white keys**
- All agents used the same methodology: counting the explicitly listed letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
- All agents correctly focused on what the question described rather than what a standard piano would have

### Areas of Disagreement
- None. Complete consensus across all agents.

### Quality Assessment
All answers demonstrated strong reasoning:
- Systematic counting approach
- Recognition that the question describes a specific piano, not a standard piano
- Clear final answers with supporting logic

## Final Synthesized Answer

The piano has **7 white keys**.

The question explicitly states that the piano has white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Counting these labels:
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F
7. G

This yields exactly 7 white keys. While a standard full-size piano has 52 white keys (with notes repeating across octaves), the question describes a specific piano with only these 7 labeled keys, indicating a single octave of white keys.

## Score Calculation

- **Answers matching expected (7)**: 5 out of 5
- **Most common answer**: 7 (appeared 5 times)
- **Agents agreeing with most common answer**: 5

**Consensus Score: 100%**

Calculation: (5 / 5) * 100 = 100%

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score**: 100%
- **Reliability Notes**: This is a straightforward reading comprehension question. All agents correctly interpreted the question and arrived at the same answer through similar reasoning. The answer is definitively 7 white keys based on the explicit information provided in the question.
