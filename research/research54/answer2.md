## Reasoning

The question states: "I have a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G."

Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question explicitly lists the labels on the white keys: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G
2. Counting these labels: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7)
3. The question says the white keys ARE labeled with these letters - it's describing what labels exist on this specific piano's white keys
4. There are exactly 7 distinct letters listed

The question is asking about THIS specific piano as described, where the white keys are labeled A through G. That's 7 labels, meaning 7 white keys.

Note: While a standard full-size piano has 52 white keys (with the note names A-G repeating across octaves), the question is specifically describing a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G - listing exactly 7 labels.
