## Reasoning

The question states: "I have a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G."

Let me count the labels explicitly mentioned:
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F
7. G

The question is describing a specific piano where the white keys are labeled with these seven letters. The question asks how many white keys this piano has based on the information provided.

Since the question explicitly states the white keys are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and lists exactly these 7 letters, the piano has 7 white keys.

Note: This is different from a standard full-size piano which has 52 white keys spanning multiple octaves. But the question is specifically asking about "my piano" which is described as having white keys labeled with just these 7 letters - suggesting a small keyboard or toy piano with only one octave of white keys.

## Final Answer

7
