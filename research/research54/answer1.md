## Reasoning

The question states: "I have a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G."

Step 1: Identify what keys are mentioned
The question explicitly lists the white keys as: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G

Step 2: Count the keys listed
- A (1)
- B (2)
- C (3)
- D (4)
- E (5)
- F (6)
- G (7)

Step 3: Consider the wording carefully
The question describes "a piano with white keys labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G" - this is describing what keys exist on this particular piano. It does not mention multiple octaves or any repetition of these notes. Based solely on the information given, the piano has exactly the seven white keys that were listed.

## Final Answer

7

The piano has 7 white keys, as explicitly stated in the question: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.
