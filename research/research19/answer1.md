## Reasoning

When objects fall in a typical living room (with normal air), two main forces act on them:

1. **Gravity** - pulls both objects downward with the same acceleration (approximately 9.8 m/s^2)
2. **Air resistance** - opposes the motion and depends on the object's shape, size, and speed

For the ball:
- It has a relatively compact shape and higher mass relative to its surface area
- Air resistance has minimal effect on its fall
- It falls nearly at the rate of free-fall acceleration

For the feather:
- It has a large surface area relative to its very small mass
- Air resistance significantly slows its descent
- It flutters and drifts slowly downward

In a vacuum (no air), both would hit the ground at exactly the same time, as Galileo demonstrated and Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott famously showed on the Moon with a hammer and feather.

However, in a living room with normal atmospheric conditions, air resistance dramatically affects the feather while having negligible effect on the ball.

## Final Answer

The ball hits the ground first. In your living room, air resistance slows the feather significantly due to its large surface area and low mass, while the ball falls with minimal air resistance. The feather will flutter slowly downward while the ball drops quickly.
