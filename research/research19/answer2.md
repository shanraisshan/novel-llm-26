## Reasoning

In a living room environment, we are dealing with normal atmospheric conditions where air resistance plays a significant role.

1. **Air resistance matters**: A living room has air at standard atmospheric pressure. Air resistance (drag) affects objects differently based on their shape, surface area relative to mass, and density.

2. **The ball**: A ball is relatively dense and compact. It has a small surface area relative to its mass, meaning air resistance has minimal effect on its fall. It will accelerate close to the rate of gravity (9.8 m/s squared).

3. **The feather**: A feather has a very large surface area relative to its very small mass. This means air resistance dramatically slows its descent. The feather reaches terminal velocity almost immediately and floats down slowly.

4. **Galileo's famous experiment**: While Galileo demonstrated that objects of different masses fall at the same rate in the absence of air resistance, this only applies in a vacuum. The Apollo 15 astronauts famously demonstrated this on the Moon, where a hammer and feather hit the ground simultaneously in the airless environment.

5. **In your living room**: Since there is air present, the feather experiences proportionally much greater drag force compared to its weight than the ball does.

## Final Answer

The ball hits the ground first. In your living room, air resistance significantly slows the feather's descent while having minimal effect on the ball. The feather will float and drift slowly downward while the ball drops quickly. This is a classic demonstration of why air resistance matters in everyday physics, and why the idealized "all objects fall at the same rate" only applies in a vacuum.
