## Reasoning

In a living room, which is filled with air, two main forces act on falling objects:

1. **Gravity**: Pulls both objects downward with the same acceleration (9.8 m/s^2). In a vacuum, both objects would fall at exactly the same rate regardless of mass.

2. **Air resistance**: Opposes the motion of falling objects. The amount of air resistance depends on the object's shape, surface area, and speed.

For the ball:
- Relatively compact and dense
- Small surface area relative to its mass
- Air resistance has minimal effect on its fall
- Falls nearly as fast as it would in a vacuum

For the feather:
- Very light with low mass
- Large surface area relative to its mass
- Air resistance has a significant effect
- Quickly reaches terminal velocity (where air resistance equals gravitational force)
- Falls much more slowly, floating and drifting as it descends

In a living room with normal air, the feather's large surface-area-to-mass ratio causes it to experience significant air resistance that dramatically slows its descent compared to the ball.

## Final Answer

The ball hits the ground first. In your living room, air resistance significantly slows the feather's fall while having minimal effect on the denser ball. The feather will float and drift slowly downward while the ball drops quickly to the floor.
