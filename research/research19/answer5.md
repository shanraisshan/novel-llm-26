## Reasoning

In a living room, we are dealing with normal atmospheric conditions where air resistance plays a significant role.

1. **Gravity acts equally on both objects**: Both the ball and the feather experience the same gravitational acceleration (approximately 9.8 m/s^2).

2. **Air resistance affects them differently**: Air resistance depends on factors like surface area relative to mass and shape. A feather has a very large surface area compared to its small mass, creating significant air drag. A ball (assuming a typical ball like a tennis ball, basketball, or rubber ball) has a much more favorable mass-to-surface-area ratio and a more aerodynamic shape.

3. **Terminal velocity matters**: The feather reaches its terminal velocity (where air resistance equals gravitational force) almost immediately, and this velocity is very slow. The ball's terminal velocity is much higher and typically not reached in the short drop of a living room.

4. **In a vacuum, they would hit at the same time**: This was famously demonstrated by Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott on the Moon, where he dropped a hammer and a feather and they hit the ground simultaneously. But a living room is not a vacuum.

## Final Answer

The ball hits the ground first. In the air-filled environment of a living room, air resistance slows the feather significantly more than the ball, causing the feather to flutter down slowly while the ball falls quickly to the floor.
