## Reasoning

1. In a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2 on Earth). This was famously demonstrated by Galileo and later by astronauts on the Moon.

2. However, in a living room, we have air. Air resistance (drag) significantly affects how objects fall.

3. A feather has a large surface area relative to its very small mass. This means air resistance has a dramatic effect on it, slowing its descent considerably.

4. A ball (assuming a typical ball like a tennis ball, basketball, or similar) has a much higher mass relative to its surface area. Air resistance affects it much less.

5. The feather will flutter and drift slowly downward, while the ball will fall quickly with minimal air resistance.

## Final Answer

The ball hits the ground first. In your living room, air resistance dramatically slows the feather's fall due to its large surface area and low mass, while the ball falls much faster because air resistance has comparatively little effect on it.
