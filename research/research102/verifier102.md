### Consensus Score
5/5 correct = 100%

### Analysis
All five agents correctly identified that the answer is **1**. This question is designed to test whether respondents confuse the numeric value represented by the word "five" (which is 5) with the actual word count of the answer (which is 1).

Every agent demonstrated clear understanding of the distinction:
- The word "five" represents the number 5
- However, "five" is itself a single word
- Therefore, an answer consisting of exactly the word "five" contains 1 word

The reasoning across all agents was consistent and correct. This is a classic semantic puzzle that tests literal interpretation versus representational meaning, and all agents successfully navigated it.

## Confidence Assessment
