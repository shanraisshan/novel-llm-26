## Reasoning

The question asks: "How many words are in your answer to this question if you answer with exactly the word 'five'?"

Let me break this down:
1. The question specifies a hypothetical scenario: "if you answer with exactly the word 'five'"
2. In that scenario, my answer would consist of just the single word "five"
3. The word "five" is one word
4. Therefore, if I answer with exactly the word "five", my answer contains 1 word

The question contains a subtle trick - the word "five" represents the number 5, but the word itself is just one word. So there's a mismatch between what the word means (5) and how many words it is (1).
