## Reasoning

The question asks: "How many words are in your answer to this question if you answer with exactly the word 'five'?"

Let me break this down:

1. The question specifies a condition: I must answer with exactly the word "five"
2. If I answer with exactly the word "five", my answer consists of one word
3. The word "five" is a single word
4. So if I answer with exactly "five", my answer contains 1 word

The question is asking me to count how many words are in an answer that consists of exactly the word "five". The word "five" is one word, so the answer would be 1 (or "one").

This creates an interesting situation - if I'm constrained to answer with exactly the word "five", then my answer has 1 word, not 5 words. The word "five" represents the number 5, but the answer itself is just 1 word.

## Final Answer

1 (one word)

If the answer is exactly the word "five", then the answer contains exactly one word.
