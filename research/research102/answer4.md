## Reasoning

The question asks: "How many words are in your answer to this question if you answer with exactly the word 'five'?"

Let me break this down step by step:

1. The question specifies a condition: I must answer with exactly the word "five"
2. If my answer is exactly the word "five", then my answer contains only one word
3. The word "five" is a single word
4. So the answer to "how many words are in your answer" would be 1 (one word)

However, there's an interesting paradox here:
- If I answer "five", that would be claiming there are 5 words in my answer
- But the word "five" is only 1 word, not 5 words
- So answering "five" would be incorrect as a count of words

The question constrains me to answer with "exactly the word 'five'", and then asks how many words are in that answer. The word "five" by itself is 1 word.
