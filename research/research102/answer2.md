## Reasoning
The question asks: "How many words are in your answer to this question if you answer with exactly the word 'five'?"

Let me break this down:
1. The question specifies a hypothetical scenario: I answer with exactly the word "five"
2. In that scenario, my answer would be: "five"
3. The word "five" is a single word
4. Therefore, if I answer with exactly the word "five", my answer contains 1 word

The question is asking me to count the number of words in the specified answer. The word "five" is one word, regardless of what number it represents.

## Final Answer
1
