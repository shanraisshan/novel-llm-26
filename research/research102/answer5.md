## Reasoning
The question asks how many words are in my answer IF I answer with exactly the word "five".

Step 1: The question specifies a hypothetical scenario - answering with exactly the word "five"
Step 2: The word "five" is a single word
Step 3: If my answer consists of exactly the word "five", then my answer contains 1 word
Step 4: Therefore, the answer to how many words are in that answer is: one (or 1)

Note: This is a self-referential puzzle. The word "five" represents the number 5, but the word itself is just one word. The question is asking about the count of words, not the numeric value the word represents.

## Final Answer
1 (one)
