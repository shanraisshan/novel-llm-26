## Reasoning

I need to count the letters in each number word when written out:

- "one" = 3 letters (o-n-e)
- "two" = 3 letters (t-w-o)
- "three" = 5 letters (t-h-r-e-e)
- "four" = 4 letters (f-o-u-r)
- "five" = 4 letters (f-i-v-e)

Adding them up: 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters

## Final Answer

19
