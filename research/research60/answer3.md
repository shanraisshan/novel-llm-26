## Reasoning

Let me break this down step by step:

1. The farmer starts with 10 sheep.
2. The problem states "all but 9 run away."
3. "All but 9" means "all except 9" - so every sheep runs away EXCEPT for 9 sheep.
4. This means 9 sheep stay with the farmer.
5. Only 1 sheep ran away (10 - 9 = 1 sheep ran away).

This is a classic trick question that plays on how we parse language. Many people rush to subtract 9 from 10, but the phrase "all but 9" actually tells us directly how many remain.

## Final Answer

9 sheep
