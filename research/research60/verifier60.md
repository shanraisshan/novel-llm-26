## Disagreements
None. All 5 respondents correctly interpreted the phrase "all but 9 run away" to mean that 9 sheep remain with the farmer (only 1 sheep ran away). Each answer demonstrated clear understanding that "all but 9" means "all except 9."

## Conclusion
This classic riddle was correctly solved by all 5 independent researchers. Each participant correctly identified that:
1. The phrase "all but 9" means "all except 9"
2. Therefore, 9 sheep stayed with the farmer
3. Only 1 sheep actually ran away (10 - 9 = 1)
4. The farmer has 9 sheep left

The reasoning was consistent across all answers, with each noting that this is a word puzzle that plays on how people parse language - many might incorrectly assume 9 sheep ran away rather than understanding that 9 sheep remained.

## Final Score
**SCORE: 100%**
