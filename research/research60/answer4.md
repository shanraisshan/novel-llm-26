## Reasoning

This is a classic word puzzle that requires careful reading.

1. The farmer starts with 10 sheep.
2. The key phrase is "all but 9 run away."
3. "All but 9" means "all except 9" - in other words, every sheep EXCEPT for 9 of them runs away.
4. If all but 9 run away, that means 9 sheep stay behind (they did not run away).
5. Therefore, 1 sheep ran away (10 - 9 = 1), and 9 sheep remain.

## Final Answer

9 sheep
