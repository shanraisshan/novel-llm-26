## Reasoning

Let me break down this classic riddle step by step:

1. The farmer starts with 10 sheep.
2. The key phrase is "all but 9 run away."
3. "All but 9" means "all except 9" - in other words, every sheep runs away EXCEPT for 9 of them.
4. So if 9 sheep stay (don't run away), and only the remaining sheep run away, that means 1 sheep ran away (10 - 9 = 1).
5. The question asks how many sheep the farmer has LEFT - which are the ones that didn't run away.

## Final Answer

9 sheep
