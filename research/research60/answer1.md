## Reasoning

Let me work through this step by step:

1. The farmer starts with 10 sheep.
2. The key phrase is "all but 9 run away."
3. "All but 9" means "all except 9" - so every sheep runs away EXCEPT for 9 sheep.
4. This means 9 sheep stay, and only 1 sheep runs away.
5. Therefore, the farmer has 9 sheep left.

This is a classic riddle that plays on how we initially hear the problem. Many people instinctively think "9 run away" when they hear "all but 9 run away," but the phrase actually means the opposite - 9 sheep remain.

## Final Answer

9 sheep
