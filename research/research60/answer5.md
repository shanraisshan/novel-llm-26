## Reasoning

Let me break this down step by step:

1. The farmer starts with 10 sheep.
2. The key phrase is "all but 9 run away."
3. "All but 9" means "all except 9" - so 9 sheep do NOT run away.
4. If 9 sheep stay (don't run away), then only 1 sheep runs away (10 - 9 = 1).
5. Therefore, the farmer still has the 9 sheep that didn't run away.

## Final Answer

9 sheep
