## Reasoning

Let me count the letter 'S' in the word 'MISSISSIPPI' by going through each letter:

M - I - S - S - I - S - S - I - P - P - I

Counting the S's:
- Position 3: S (1st)
- Position 4: S (2nd)
- Position 6: S (3rd)
- Position 7: S (4th)

Total count: 4 letters 'S'

4 is an even number (divisible by 2 with no remainder).

## Final Answer

Even
