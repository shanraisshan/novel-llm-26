## Reasoning

Let me count the letter 'S' in the word 'MISSISSIPPI' by going through each letter:

M - I - S - S - I - S - S - I - P - P - I

Counting the S's:
1. Position 3: S
2. Position 4: S
3. Position 6: S
4. Position 7: S

Total count: 4 letters 'S'

Now I need to determine if 4 is odd or even:
- A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder
- 4 / 2 = 2 (no remainder)
- Therefore, 4 is an even number

## Final Answer

The word 'MISSISSIPPI' has an **even** number of the letter 'S' (specifically, 4 S's).
