I need to count the letters in 'FIVE LETTERS'.

Let me work through this step by step:

**Word 1: FIVE**
- F, I, V, E
- That's 4 letters

**Word 2: LETTERS**
- L, E, T, T, E, R, S
- That's 7 letters

**Total count:**
- 4 + 7 = **11 letters**

Note: I'm counting only the alphabetic characters, not the space between the words. If you wanted to include the space, the answer would be 12 characters total.
