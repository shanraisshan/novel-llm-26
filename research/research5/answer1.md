Let me think through this step by step.

The phrase is: **'FIVE LETTERS'**

Let me count the letters (excluding the space):

**FIVE**: F-I-V-E = 4 letters

**LETTERS**: L-E-T-T-E-R-S = 7 letters

**Total**: 4 + 7 = **11 letters**

So 'FIVE LETTERS' contains **11 letters** (not counting the space between the words).

Interestingly, this is a self-referential trick question - the phrase says "five letters" but actually contains 11 letters!
