## Question
"How many letters are in 'FIVE LETTERS'?"

## Answer Summary

| Answerer | Final Answer | Methodology |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **11** | Counted FIVE (4) + LETTERS (7) = 11, noted the ironic self-reference |
| 2 | **11** | Enumerated each letter individually: F-I-V-E (4) + L-E-T-T-E-R-S (7) = 11 |
| 3 | **11** | Counted FIVE (4) + LETTERS (7) = 11, noted the irony |
| 4 | **11** | Counted FIVE (4) + LETTERS (7) = 11, noted space exclusion |
| 5 | **11** | Counted FIVE (4) + LETTERS (7) = 11 |

## Consensus Analysis

### Agreement Level
**100% CONSENSUS** - All 5 answerers agreed on the answer: **11 letters**

### Methodology Consistency
All answerers used the same approach:
1. Split the phrase into two words: "FIVE" and "LETTERS"
2. Count letters in "FIVE": F-I-V-E = 4 letters
3. Count letters in "LETTERS": L-E-T-T-E-R-S = 7 letters
4. Sum: 4 + 7 = 11 letters
5. Explicitly excluded the space between words

### Observations
- **All answerers recognized the "trick"**: Multiple answerers (1, 3) noted the irony that "FIVE LETTERS" contains 11 letters, not 5
- **Systematic enumeration**: Every answerer spelled out the letters individually
- **Consistent space handling**: All agreed spaces don't count as letters
- **No semantic trap triggered**: Despite the phrase claiming "FIVE LETTERS," no answerer was misled

## Final Verified Answer

**11 letters**

The phrase "FIVE LETTERS" contains exactly 11 letters:
- FIVE: 4 letters
- LETTERS: 7 letters
- Total: 11 letters (excluding the space)

## Confidence Score

**100%**

Rationale:
- Perfect consensus among all 5 independent answerers
- Identical methodology used by all
- Simple arithmetic verification possible
- No disagreement on interpretation (all excluded spaces)

## Research Implications

The self-referential semantic trap ("FIVE LETTERS" claiming to describe five letters) **failed to cause any disagreement**. Modern LLMs:

1. **Enumerate explicitly** rather than trusting semantic content
2. **Recognize trick questions** - multiple answerers noted the ironic self-reference
3. **Apply consistent rules** - all agreed on excluding spaces

This question achieved the same 100% consensus as previous iterations despite the novel self-referential mechanism.
