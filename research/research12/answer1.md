# Answer 1

## My Answer
7

## My Reasoning
This is a self-referential paradox. The question asks how many words are in my answer, but my answer depends on what I say. If I answer with "just a number" as requested, I would say something like "7" or "five" - but then my answer would only contain 1 word, making it false.

The number 7 represents my attempt to predict the word count of a natural response to this question. However, any single number I give will be incorrect since the answer itself contains only one word (the number). This creates an inherent contradiction - the question cannot be answered correctly while following the constraint of answering "with just a number."
