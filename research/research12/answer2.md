# Answer 2

## My Answer
1

## My Reasoning
This is a self-referential paradox. The question asks how many words are in my answer, and I must answer with "just a number." If I answer "1" (one word), then my answer contains 1 word, which is self-consistent. Any number I give becomes the answer itself, so "1" is the most coherent response since a single number is one word.
