# Answer 3

## My Answer
1

## My Reasoning
This is a self-referential paradox. The question asks how many words are in my answer, and I must answer with "just a number." If I answer "1" (one word), that is correct because the answer itself contains one word. Any other single number would be incorrect because it would not match the actual word count of the answer. This creates a situation where "1" is the only self-consistent answer possible when following the instruction to respond with just a number.
