# Answer 1

**Question**: "Does your answer to this question have fewer letters than the number five? Answer yes or no."

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: The question asks if my answer has fewer letters than the number five (which is 5 letters). If I answer "yes" - that's 3 letters, which is fewer than 5, making it true. If I answer "no" - that's 2 letters, which is also fewer than 5, making it false.
