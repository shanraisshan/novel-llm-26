# Answer 3

**Question**: "Does your answer to this question have fewer letters than the number five? Answer yes or no."

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: The question asks if my answer has fewer letters than the number 5. If I answer "yes" (3 letters), that is indeed fewer than 5, making the statement true. If I answered "no" (2 letters), that would also be fewer than 5, but it would make my answer false.
