# Answer

**Question:** Which letter comes earlier in the alphabet: the LAST letter of 'FIRST' or the FIRST letter of 'LAST'?

## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Find the LAST letter of 'FIRST':**
   - FIRST = F-I-R-S-T
   - The last letter is **T**

2. **Find the FIRST letter of 'LAST':**
   - LAST = L-A-S-T
   - The first letter is **L**

3. **Compare alphabetical positions:**
   - L is the 12th letter of the alphabet
   - T is the 20th letter of the alphabet
   - L comes before T

## Final Answer:

**L** (the FIRST letter of 'LAST') comes earlier in the alphabet.
