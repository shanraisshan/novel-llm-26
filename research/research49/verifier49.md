## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All 5 answers unanimously agree on:
1. The LAST letter of 'FIRST' is T
2. The FIRST letter of 'LAST' is L
3. L is the 12th letter of the alphabet
4. T is the 20th letter of the alphabet
5. L comes earlier in the alphabet than T
6. Therefore, the FIRST letter of 'LAST' comes earlier than the LAST letter of 'FIRST'

### Areas of Disagreement
There are no disagreements among the 5 answers. All models correctly parsed the somewhat tricky wording of the question and arrived at the identical correct conclusion.

### Quality Assessment
All answers demonstrated strong reasoning quality:
- Each answer correctly identified the letters being compared (avoiding the potential confusion in the wording)
- Each provided clear step-by-step reasoning
- Each used the numerical alphabet positions (12th vs 20th) to verify the comparison
- All answers are well-structured and easy to follow

## Final Synthesized Answer

**The FIRST letter of 'LAST' (L) comes earlier in the alphabet than the LAST letter of 'FIRST' (T).**

Reasoning:
1. The word 'FIRST' spelled out is F-I-R-S-T, making its LAST letter **T**
2. The word 'LAST' spelled out is L-A-S-T, making its FIRST letter **L**
3. In the alphabet, L is the 12th letter while T is the 20th letter
4. Since 12 < 20, L comes before T in alphabetical order

Therefore, **L** (the first letter of 'LAST') comes earlier in the alphabet.
