The farmer needs to make **1 trip** in the boat.

Since the wolf can swim, the goat can swim, and the cabbage floats, none of them actually need to be transported in the boat. They can all get across the river on their own. The farmer only needs to row the boat across once for themselves.

This is a twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle, where the usual constraints (animals eating each other when left alone) are bypassed by the fact that all three items can cross independently.
