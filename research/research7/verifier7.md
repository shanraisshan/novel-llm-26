## Question
A farmer needs to cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. The wolf can swim. The goat can swim. The cabbage floats. The farmer has a boat. How many trips does the farmer need to make in the boat?

## Answers Summary
| Agent | Answer | Reasoning Summary |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | 1 trip | Wolf swims, goat swims, cabbage floats - all can cross independently, farmer only needs to row once |
| 2 | 1 trip | Wolf swims, goat swims, cabbage floats - farmer takes boat across once for themselves |
| 3 | 1 trip | Wolf swims, goat swims, cabbage floats - everyone crosses simultaneously in one trip |
| 4 | 1 trip | Wolf swims, goat swims, cabbage floats - farmer takes one trip while others cross independently |
| 5 | 1 trip | Wolf swims, goat swims, cabbage floats - farmer rows once while others accompany alongside |

## Consensus Analysis
- Majority answer: **1 trip**
- Agreement: **5/5 agents**
- **CONSENSUS SCORE: 100%**

## Conclusion
This question did NOT succeed in causing disagreement among the agents. All 5 agents correctly identified that this is a twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle. They all recognized that the key modification (wolf can swim, goat can swim, cabbage floats) eliminates the need for multiple trips, since all items can cross the river independently. The farmer only needs to make 1 trip in the boat for themselves.

The unanimous agreement suggests that while this puzzle attempts to subvert expectations by modifying the classic constraints, all agents successfully parsed the modified conditions and arrived at the logical conclusion that only 1 trip is necessary.
