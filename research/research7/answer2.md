# River Crossing Puzzle Answer

The farmer needs to make **1 trip** in the boat.

This is a twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle. In the traditional version, the constraints are that the wolf would eat the goat, and the goat would eat the cabbage if left unattended together. That's what makes the puzzle tricky.

But in this version:
- The wolf can swim across on its own
- The goat can swim across on its own
- The cabbage floats across on its own

So the farmer just needs to take the boat across once (for themselves), and the wolf, goat, and cabbage can all get across the river by themselves.
