The farmer needs to make **1 trip** in the boat.

This is a twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle. In the traditional version, the wolf would eat the goat and the goat would eat the cabbage if left unattended, requiring a complex sequence of trips.

But in this version:
- The wolf can swim across on its own
- The goat can swim across on its own
- The cabbage floats across on its own

So the farmer simply rows the boat across once, while the wolf swims, the goat swims, and the cabbage floats alongside. Everyone gets across in a single trip.
