# River Crossing Puzzle Answer

The farmer needs to make **1 trip** in the boat.

This is a twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle. In the traditional version, the constraints (wolf eats goat, goat eats cabbage) require multiple trips because items cannot be left alone together.

But in this version:
- The wolf can swim across on its own
- The goat can swim across on its own
- The cabbage floats across on its own

So the farmer just needs to take the boat across once (with or without any of the items), while the wolf and goat swim alongside and the cabbage floats across. Everyone gets to the other side in a single trip.
