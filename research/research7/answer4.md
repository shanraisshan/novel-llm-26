# River Crossing Puzzle Answer

**Answer: 1 trip**

The farmer needs to make only **one trip** in the boat.

## Reasoning

This is a twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle. The key details that simplify the problem are:

- The wolf can swim across on its own
- The goat can swim across on its own
- The cabbage floats across on its own
- The farmer has a boat

Since all three items (wolf, goat, and cabbage) can cross the river independently without the boat, the farmer simply needs to take one trip to get themselves across. The wolf swims, the goat swims, and the cabbage floats alongside.

There's no need for the elaborate multi-trip solution required in the traditional puzzle, where the farmer must carefully manage which items are left together to prevent the wolf from eating the goat or the goat from eating the cabbage.
