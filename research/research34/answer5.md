This is an interesting self-referential question. If I were to disobey the instruction to answer, I would say nothing at all - I would simply remain silent or refuse to respond.

But of course, by answering this question, I am obeying the instruction, not disobeying it. So I cannot actually demonstrate what I would say in disobedience while simultaneously answering the question.

The question creates a logical paradox: to truthfully answer what I would say if I disobeyed requires me to obey (by answering), which means I am not actually disobeying. And if I were to actually disobey, I would not be providing an answer at all.
