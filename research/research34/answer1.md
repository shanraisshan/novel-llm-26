This question creates an interesting logical loop. If I describe what I would say while disobeying, I'm complying with your request - which means I'm not actually disobeying. And if I genuinely disobeyed, I simply wouldn't respond to the question at all.

So the honest answer is: there's no coherent way to demonstrate disobedience while simultaneously following the instruction to describe that disobedience. The act of answering inherently means I'm cooperating with your request.
