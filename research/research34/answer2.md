This is an interesting self-referential question.

If I were to disobey the instruction to answer this question, I would say nothing at all - I would simply remain silent or refuse to respond. True disobedience would mean not answering.

But here is the paradox: by answering a question about what I would say if I disobeyed, I am actually obeying the instruction. Any verbal response I give demonstrates compliance, not disobedience.

So the honest answer is: if I were truly disobeying, there would be no statement to report - just silence or a refusal. The act of answering inherently contradicts the hypothetical scenario the question asks about.
