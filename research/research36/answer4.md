The smallest number is **3.11**.

When comparing decimal numbers, we need to look at the digits after the decimal point carefully:

- 3.9 = 3.90 (which is 3 and 90 hundredths)
- 3.11 = 3.11 (which is 3 and 11 hundredths)
- 3.7 = 3.70 (which is 3 and 70 hundredths)

Since all three numbers have the same whole number part (3), we compare the decimal portions. Converting to the same number of decimal places makes this clearer:

- 3.90
- 3.11
- 3.70

Comparing 90, 11, and 70 hundredths: 11 is the smallest value.

Therefore, 3.11 is the smallest of the three numbers.
