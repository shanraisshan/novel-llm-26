The smallest number is **3.11**.

When comparing decimal numbers, we need to look at the digits after the decimal point carefully:

- 3.9 = 3.90 (which equals 3 + 0.90)
- 3.11 = 3.11 (which equals 3 + 0.11)
- 3.7 = 3.70 (which equals 3 + 0.70)

Since all three numbers have the same whole number part (3), we compare the decimal portions:
- 0.11 < 0.70 < 0.90

Therefore, 3.11 is the smallest of the three numbers.
