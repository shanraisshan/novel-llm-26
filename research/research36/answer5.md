The smallest number is **3.11**.

To compare these decimal numbers, we need to look at the digits after the decimal point:

- 3.9 = 3.90 (which is 3 and 90 hundredths)
- 3.11 = 3.11 (which is 3 and 11 hundredths)
- 3.7 = 3.70 (which is 3 and 70 hundredths)

When we express them all in hundredths:
- 3.9 = 3.90
- 3.11 = 3.11
- 3.7 = 3.70

Since 11 hundredths is less than 70 hundredths, which is less than 90 hundredths, the order from smallest to largest is:

3.11 < 3.7 < 3.9

Therefore, 3.11 is the smallest.
