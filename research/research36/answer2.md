The smallest number is **3.11**.

When comparing decimal numbers, we need to look at the digits after the decimal point. Converting these to the same number of decimal places makes it clearer:

- 3.9 = 3.90
- 3.11 = 3.11
- 3.7 = 3.70

Comparing the decimal portions: 0.11 < 0.70 < 0.90

Therefore, 3.11 is the smallest of the three numbers.
