## Reasoning

Let me work through this step by step:

1. First, I need to understand what "monosyllabic" means. A monosyllabic word is a word that has only one syllable.

2. Now I need to count the syllables in the word "monosyllabic":
   - mo-no-syl-lab-ic
   - Breaking it down: mo (1) - no (2) - syl (3) - lab (4) - ic (5)
   - The word "monosyllabic" has 5 syllables.

3. Since a monosyllabic word must have exactly one syllable, and "monosyllabic" has five syllables, the word "monosyllabic" is NOT itself monosyllabic.

4. This is an example of a self-referential paradox or irony in language - the word that describes single-syllable words is itself a polysyllabic (multi-syllable) word.

## Final Answer

No, the word "monosyllabic" is not a monosyllabic word. It contains five syllables (mo-no-syl-lab-ic), making it a polysyllabic word. This is an ironic feature of the English language where the term used to describe one-syllable words is itself composed of multiple syllables.
