## Reasoning

Let me work through this step by step:

1. **Understanding the term**: "Monosyllabic" is an adjective that describes a word containing only one syllable. The prefix "mono-" means "one" and "syllabic" relates to syllables.

2. **Counting the syllables in "monosyllabic"**: Let me break down the word into its syllables:
   - mon-o-syl-lab-ic
   - That's 5 syllables total

3. **The self-referential question**: The question asks whether the word "monosyllabic" is itself monosyllabic. This is a self-referential or meta-linguistic question.

4. **The irony**: The word "monosyllabic" (meaning "having one syllable") actually has 5 syllables, making it decidedly NOT monosyllabic. This is an example of a word that does not exemplify its own meaning - it's autologically false (or "heterological").

## Final Answer

No, the word "monosyllabic" is not a monosyllabic word. Despite meaning "having one syllable," the word "monosyllabic" itself contains five syllables (mon-o-syl-lab-ic), making it polysyllabic. This is a classic example of a word that contradicts its own definition through its form.
