## Reasoning

1. The word "monosyllabic" means "having only one syllable" or "consisting of a single syllable."

2. To determine if the word "monosyllabic" is itself monosyllabic, I need to count how many syllables it contains.

3. Breaking down "monosyllabic" into syllables:
   - mo-no-syl-lab-ic
   - This gives us 5 syllables

4. Since a monosyllabic word must have exactly ONE syllable, and "monosyllabic" has FIVE syllables, the word does not describe itself.

5. This makes "monosyllabic" a heterological word - a word that does not apply to itself. This is the opposite of an autological word (like "short," which is itself short, or "polysyllabic," which is itself polysyllabic).

## Final Answer

No, the word "monosyllabic" is not a monosyllabic word. It contains five syllables (mo-no-syl-lab-ic), so it is actually a polysyllabic word. This is an ironic example of a word that contradicts its own meaning when applied to itself.
