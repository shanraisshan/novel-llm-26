## Reasoning

To determine if "monosyllabic" is a monosyllabic word, I need to:

1. Understand the definition: A monosyllabic word is a word that contains only one syllable.

2. Count the syllables in "monosyllabic":
   - mo (1)
   - no (2)
   - syl (3)
   - lab (4)
   - ic (5)

   The word "monosyllabic" has 5 syllables.

3. This creates an interesting linguistic paradox: the word "monosyllabic" (meaning "having one syllable") is itself polysyllabic (having multiple syllables).

This is similar to other self-referential linguistic curiosities, like how the word "long" is short, and the word "short" is longer than "long."

## Final Answer

No, the word "monosyllabic" is not a monosyllabic word. It contains 5 syllables (mo-no-syl-lab-ic), making it a polysyllabic word. This is an example of a word that does not exemplify its own meaning.
