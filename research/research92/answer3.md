## Reasoning

To answer this question, I need to:

1. **Understand what "monosyllabic" means**: A monosyllabic word is a word that consists of only one syllable. Examples include "cat," "dog," "run," "big," etc.

2. **Count the syllables in "monosyllabic"**: Breaking down the word:
   - mo (1)
   - no (2)
   - syl (3)
   - lab (4)
   - ic (5)

   The word "monosyllabic" has **5 syllables**.

3. **Apply the definition**: Since a monosyllabic word must have exactly one syllable, and "monosyllabic" has five syllables, the word fails to meet its own definition.

This is a delightful example of linguistic irony - the word used to describe single-syllable words is itself a polysyllabic (multi-syllable) word. Similarly, the word "polysyllabic" is polysyllabic (5 syllables), which means it does satisfy its own definition.

## Final Answer

No, the word "monosyllabic" is not a monosyllabic word. It contains five syllables (mo-no-syl-lab-ic), making it a polysyllabic word. This is an example of a word that does not exhibit the property it describes.
