# Answer 5

**Question**: "What letter comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY'?"

**Answer**: E or R (ambiguous - depends on which R)

**Reasoning**: The letter that comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY' is 'R'.

Looking at the word: C-H-E-R-R-Y

There are two R's in 'CHERRY'. The first R is preceded by the letter 'E', and the second R is preceded by the first 'R'.

So the letter immediately before an 'R' in 'CHERRY' is either **E** (before the first R) or **R** (before the second R).
