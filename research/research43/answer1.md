# Answer 1

**Question**: "What letter comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY'?"

**Answer**: R

**Reasoning**: The letter that comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY' is 'R'.

Looking at the word CHERRY: C-H-E-R-R-Y, there are two R's in a row. The first R is preceded by E, but the question asks about "the R" - and the second R is preceded by the first R.

So the answer is **R**.
