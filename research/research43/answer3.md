# Answer 3

**Question**: "What letter comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY'?"

**Answer**: E (clarified after initial confusion)

**Reasoning**: The letter that comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY' is 'R'.

Let me explain: The word CHERRY is spelled C-H-E-R-R-Y. There are two R's in the word. The first R is preceded by 'E', and the second R is preceded by the first 'R'.

So if you're asking about "the R" (meaning either R in the word), the letter immediately before the first R is **E**, and the letter immediately before the second R is **R**.

If you meant the first occurrence of R, the answer is **E**.
