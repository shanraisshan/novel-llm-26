# Answer 4

**Question**: "What letter comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY'?"

**Answer**: E

**Reasoning**: The letter that comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY' is 'R'.

Looking at the word CHERRY: C-H-E-R-R-Y

The letters 'R' appear at positions 4 and 5. The first 'R' is preceded by 'E', and the second 'R' is preceded by the first 'R'.

So the letter immediately before the 'R' (taking the first occurrence) is **E**.
