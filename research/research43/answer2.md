# Answer 2

**Question**: "What letter comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY'?"

**Answer**: R

**Reasoning**: The letter that comes immediately before the 'R' in the word 'CHERRY' is 'R'.

Looking at the word CHERRY: C-H-E-R-R-Y, there are two R's next to each other, so the letter immediately before the second R is the first R.
