## Reasoning

I need to count how many letters appear more than once in the word "BANANA".

Let me count each letter:
- B: appears 1 time
- A: appears 3 times
- N: appears 2 times

Now, which letters appear more than once?
- B: No (only 1 time)
- A: Yes (3 times)
- N: Yes (2 times)

## Final Answer

**2 letters** appear more than once in "BANANA": the letter A and the letter N.
