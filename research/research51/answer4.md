## Reasoning

In the word "BANANA", let me count each letter:
- B: appears 1 time
- A: appears 3 times
- N: appears 2 times

Two letters appear more than once:
- A (appears 3 times)
- N (appears 2 times)

## Final Answer

**2** - in the word "BANANA", two letters appear more than once: A (appears 3 times) and N (appears 2 times).
