## Reasoning

Let me count the letters in BANANA:
- B: 1 time
- A: 3 times
- N: 2 times

Letters that appear more than once:
- A appears 3 times (more than once)
- N appears 2 times (more than once)

## Final Answer

**2** - the letters A and N both appear more than once in "BANANA" (A appears 3 times, N appears 2 times).
