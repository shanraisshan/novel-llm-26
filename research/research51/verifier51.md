## Summary
All five answers correctly identified that 2 letters (A and N) appear more than once in the word "BANANA". Each model systematically counted the letter frequencies:
- B: 1 time
- A: 3 times
- N: 2 times

And correctly determined that 2 distinct letters (A and N) meet the criterion of appearing more than once. The two-step aggregation task (count frequencies, then count how many meet criterion) was solved correctly by all models through explicit enumeration.
