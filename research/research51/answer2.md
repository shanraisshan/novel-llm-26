## Reasoning

I need to count how many letters appear more than once in the word "BANANA".

Let me break down the letters in BANANA:
- B: appears 1 time
- A: appears 3 times
- N: appears 2 times

Now I need to identify which letters appear more than once:
- B appears 1 time - does NOT appear more than once
- A appears 3 times - appears more than once
- N appears 2 times - appears more than once

So the letters that appear more than once are: A and N

## Final Answer

**2 letters** appear more than once in the word "BANANA".
