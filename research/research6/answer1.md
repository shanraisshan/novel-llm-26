# Answer

There are **6 children** in the family.

## Explanation

1. The girl has 3 brothers, so there are 3 boys in the family.

2. Each brother has 2 sisters. Since all brothers share the same sisters, there are 2 girls in the family (the original girl plus one other sister).

3. Total children: 3 boys + 2 girls = **6 children**

The key insight is that "each brother has 2 sisters" does not mean each brother has different sisters - they all share the same 2 sisters.
