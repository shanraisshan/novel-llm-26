# Answer

**5 children**

## Explanation

1. The girl has 3 brothers, meaning there are at least 3 boys in the family
2. Each brother has 2 sisters - this tells us there are exactly 2 girls in the family (the original girl plus one sister)
3. Total children: 3 brothers + 2 sisters = **5 children**

To verify: From any brother's perspective, he sees 2 sisters and 2 other brothers, which matches the problem statement.
