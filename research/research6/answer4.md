# Answer

**5 children**

## Explanation

1. The girl has 3 brothers, so there are 3 boys in the family.
2. Each brother has 2 sisters. This tells us there are exactly 2 girls in the family (including the original girl).
3. The original girl mentioned in the problem is one of the 2 sisters.

Therefore, the family has:
- 3 boys (the brothers)
- 2 girls (the sisters)

**Total: 3 + 2 = 5 children**
