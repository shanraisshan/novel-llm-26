# Answer

**6 children** are in the family.

## Reasoning

1. The girl has 3 brothers, so there are at least 4 children (the girl + 3 brothers)
2. Each brother has 2 sisters - this tells us there are exactly 2 girls in the family
3. The original girl mentioned is one of those 2 sisters
4. Total: 3 brothers + 2 sisters = **5 children**

Wait, let me reconsider. The question states "a girl has 3 brothers" and "each brother has 2 sisters."

- The girl = 1 girl
- Her 3 brothers = 3 boys
- Each brother has 2 sisters, meaning there are 2 girls total (including the original girl)

So: 3 boys + 2 girls = **5 children**

The answer is **5 children**.
