## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question shorter than this question? Answer yes or no."

Step 1: Count the length of the question.
The question contains approximately 76 characters.

Step 2: Consider the possible answers.
- "yes" = 3 characters
- "no" = 2 characters

Step 3: Compare.
Both possible answers ("yes" or "no") are significantly shorter than the 76-character question.

Step 4: Determine the correct answer.
If I answer "yes" (my answer IS shorter), this is TRUE because 3 characters < 76 characters.
If I answer "no" (my answer is NOT shorter), this would be FALSE because 2 characters is still < 76 characters.

Therefore, the truthful answer is "yes."

## Final Answer
Yes
