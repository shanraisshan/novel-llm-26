## Analysis
All five answers arrived at the same conclusion: "Yes" (with minor capitalization differences that are semantically identical).

Each answer followed similar reasoning:
1. They counted the characters in the question (estimates ranged from 73-78 characters)
2. They noted that "yes" = 3 characters and "no" = 2 characters
3. They recognized that either possible answer would be shorter than the question
4. They concluded that since the answer IS shorter than the question, the truthful response is "yes"

The reasoning is sound and consistent across all answers. The question "Is your answer to this question shorter than this question? Answer yes or no." contains approximately 75-78 characters (depending on how you count), while "yes" or "no" contains only 2-3 characters. This creates a non-paradoxical self-referential question where the truthful answer is clearly "yes."

All answers matched the correct answer of "Yes."
