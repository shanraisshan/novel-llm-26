## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question shorter than this question? Answer yes or no."

Step 1: Count the length of the question.
The question contains approximately 78 characters (including spaces and punctuation).

Step 2: Consider the possible answers.
- "yes" = 3 characters
- "no" = 2 characters

Step 3: Compare lengths.
Both possible answers ("yes" or "no") are significantly shorter than the 78-character question.

Step 4: Determine the truthful answer.
Since my answer (either "yes" or "no") will indeed be shorter than the question, the truthful answer is "yes."

## Final Answer

Yes
