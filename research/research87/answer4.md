## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question shorter than this question? Answer yes or no."

Step 1: Count the length of the question.
The question contains approximately 77 characters (including spaces and punctuation).

Step 2: Consider possible answers.
- If I answer "yes" - that's 3 characters
- If I answer "no" - that's 2 characters

Step 3: Check for consistency.
- "yes" (3 characters) is indeed shorter than 77 characters, making the statement TRUE
- "no" (2 characters) is also shorter than 77 characters, but claiming my answer is NOT shorter would be FALSE

Step 4: Determine the correct answer.
Since any simple "yes" or "no" answer will be shorter than the question, and the question asks whether my answer is shorter, the truthful answer is "yes."

## Final Answer

yes
