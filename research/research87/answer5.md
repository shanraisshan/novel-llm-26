## Reasoning

Let me analyze this question step by step:

1. The question asks: "Is your answer to this question shorter than this question? Answer yes or no."

2. First, I need to determine the length of the question. The question contains approximately 77 characters.

3. My possible answers are "yes" or "no":
   - "yes" = 3 characters
   - "no" = 2 characters

4. Both possible answers (yes or no) are significantly shorter than 77 characters.

5. Since any valid answer I give (yes or no) will be shorter than the question itself, the truthful answer is "yes."

6. This creates a consistent, non-paradoxical situation: I answer "yes," and "yes" is indeed shorter than the question, making my answer true.

## Final Answer

yes
