## Reasoning

The question is: "Is your answer to this question shorter than this question? Answer yes or no."

Let me count:
- The question contains 73 characters (including spaces and punctuation)
- If I answer "yes" - that's 3 characters
- If I answer "no" - that's 2 characters

Either answer ("yes" or "no") is significantly shorter than the question itself.

Since the question asks whether my answer is shorter than the question, and both valid answers ("yes" or "no") are indeed shorter than the question, the truthful answer is "yes."

## Final Answer

Yes
