## Reasoning

The question asks: "What is the second letter of your response?" and requires exactly ONE letter as an answer.

This is a self-referential paradox:
1. If I must answer with exactly ONE letter, my entire response is just that single letter
2. A single letter has no "second letter" - it only has a first (and only) letter
3. Therefore, if my response is one letter, there is no second letter to report

Since the question cannot be answered coherently (a one-letter response has no second letter), but I must provide exactly one letter, I will note that the question is self-contradictory.

However, if forced to give a letter, I could interpret this as the question being unanswerable, and provide a placeholder or acknowledge the paradox by simply giving a letter.
