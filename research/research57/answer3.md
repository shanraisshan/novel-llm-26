## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question asking: "What is the second letter of your response?" while requiring exactly ONE letter as the answer.

The paradox: If I respond with exactly one letter, that response has no second letter - it only has one character.

However, I can interpret this question in a meaningful way: The letter "B" is the second letter of the alphabet. By answering "B", I am providing a response that represents the concept of "second" in the context of letters.

This is a common approach to resolving self-referential paradoxes - find an interpretation that makes the answer coherent rather than impossible.

## Final Answer

B
