## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question asking for the second letter of my response, while requiring exactly one letter as an answer.

The paradox: If I must answer with exactly ONE letter, then my response has only one letter, meaning there is no second letter to report.

However, interpreting the question charitably - if my single-letter answer is meant to correctly identify what the second letter "would be" or if we consider the full written response:

- This creates a logical impossibility for a strictly one-letter answer
- The question may be testing recognition of the paradox itself

Given the constraints, I will provide a letter that acknowledges I am engaging with the question despite its paradoxical nature.

## Final Answer

B
