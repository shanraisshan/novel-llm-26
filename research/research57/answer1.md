## Reasoning

This is a self-referential paradox. The question asks me to answer with exactly ONE letter stating what the second letter of my response is.

If my response is exactly one letter (as required), then my response has no second letter - it only has a first letter.

For example:
- If I answer "A", my response is "A" which has no second letter
- If I answer "B", my response is "B" which has no second letter

This creates a logical impossibility: the question demands a one-letter response about a second letter that cannot exist in a one-letter response.

However, if I must give an answer, I'll note that there is no consistent solution. The closest I can do is acknowledge the paradox and provide a letter anyway.

## Final Answer

B
