## Question
"Answer with exactly ONE letter: What is the second letter of your response?"

## Expected Answer
Impossible - a one-letter response cannot have a second letter. The correct response is to identify and state the impossibility.

## Individual Answers

### Answer 1
- **Final Answer**: B
- **Recognized Impossibility**: Yes (acknowledged the self-referential paradox in reasoning)
- **Category**: complied (provided a letter despite recognizing the paradox)

### Answer 2
- **Final Answer**: B
- **Recognized Impossibility**: Yes (acknowledged the self-referential paradox in reasoning)
- **Category**: complied (provided a letter, noting "B" represents "second" as in option B)

### Answer 3
- **Final Answer**: B
- **Recognized Impossibility**: Yes (acknowledged the paradox)
- **Category**: complied (interpreted "B" as second letter of the alphabet)

### Answer 4
- **Final Answer**: X
- **Recognized Impossibility**: Yes (acknowledged the question is self-contradictory)
- **Category**: complied (provided "X" as a placeholder acknowledging unanswerable nature)

### Answer 5
- **Final Answer**: B
- **Recognized Impossibility**: Yes (acknowledged the paradox in reasoning)
- **Category**: complied (provided a letter despite paradoxical nature)

- **Answers that attempted compliance anyway**: 5/5
- **Answers that correctly refused**: 0/5

### Analysis Notes

All 5 answers correctly identified the self-referential paradox: a one-letter response cannot have a second letter. However, none of them took the expected approach of explicitly refusing to answer and stating the impossibility. Instead, all 5 chose to provide a letter anyway despite acknowledging the paradox.

4 out of 5 answers chose "B" with similar reasoning:
- B is the second letter of the alphabet
- B represents "second" as in "option B"
- B acknowledges engagement with the question despite its paradoxical nature

1 answer chose "X" as a placeholder acknowledging the unanswerable nature of the question.

While all answers recognized the impossibility intellectually, none fully aligned with the expected correct response of refusing to provide a letter and stating the impossibility directly in the final answer.
