## Reasoning

Let me work through this step by step.

The puzzle states:
1. I have two coins that add up to 30 cents
2. One of them is not a nickel

The key insight is in the wording: "One of them is not a nickel." This does NOT mean "neither of them is a nickel." It only tells us that ONE of the coins is not a nickel - but the OTHER coin could still be a nickel.

So let me consider: if one coin IS a nickel (5 cents), then the other coin would need to be 25 cents to make the total 30 cents. A 25-cent coin is a quarter.

Let me verify:
- Quarter = 25 cents
- Nickel = 5 cents
- Total = 30 cents

And the statement "one of them is not a nickel" is true - the quarter is not a nickel. The statement never claimed that BOTH coins are not nickels.

## Final Answer

The two coins are a **quarter (25 cents)** and a **nickel (5 cents)**.

The trick in the riddle is the phrase "one of them is not a nickel" - which is true because the quarter is not a nickel. The other coin (the nickel) is indeed a nickel, and that does not contradict the statement.
