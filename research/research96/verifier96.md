## Summary
All five research participants correctly identified the answer to this classic riddle. Each participant recognized the key linguistic trick in the puzzle: the phrase "one of them is not a nickel" does not mean "neither of them is a nickel." It only states that ONE of the coins is not a nickel, which allows the OTHER coin to still be a nickel. All participants arrived at the correct answer of a quarter (25 cents) and a nickel (5 cents), which totals 30 cents and satisfies the condition that one of them (the quarter) is not a nickel. There was unanimous agreement with identical reasoning across all five answers.
