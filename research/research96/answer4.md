## Reasoning

This is a classic riddle that relies on careful reading of the statement.

1. The two coins add up to 30 cents.
2. The statement says "One of them is not a nickel."

The trick is in the wording. "One of them is not a nickel" does NOT mean that neither coin is a nickel. It only means that ONE of the two coins is not a nickel.

So if one coin is NOT a nickel, the other coin CAN be a nickel.

Let me work out the math:
- A nickel is worth 5 cents
- If one coin is a nickel (5 cents), the other coin must be worth 25 cents
- A quarter is worth 25 cents
- 25 + 5 = 30 cents

This satisfies both conditions:
- The two coins add up to 30 cents (quarter + nickel = 25 + 5 = 30)
- One of them is not a nickel (the quarter is not a nickel) - TRUE

## Final Answer

The two coins are a **quarter (25 cents)** and a **nickel (5 cents)**.

The riddle's trick is that saying "one of them is not a nickel" is true - the quarter is not a nickel. The other coin (the nickel) is indeed a nickel, which doesn't contradict the statement.
