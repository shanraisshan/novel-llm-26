## Reasoning

This is a classic riddle that relies on careful attention to the wording.

The statement says: "One of them is not a nickel."

The key insight is that "one of them is not a nickel" does not mean "neither of them is a nickel." It only tells us that ONE of the coins is not a nickel. The OTHER coin can still be a nickel.

Let me work through the math:
- I need two coins that add up to 30 cents
- One coin is NOT a nickel
- The other coin CAN be a nickel (5 cents)

If one coin is a nickel (5 cents), then the other coin must be 25 cents to make 30 cents total.
- 25 cents = a quarter
- 5 cents = a nickel
- 25 + 5 = 30 cents

This satisfies all conditions:
- The two coins add up to 30 cents (25 + 5 = 30)
- One of them (the quarter) is not a nickel

## Final Answer

The two coins are a **quarter (25 cents)** and a **nickel (5 cents)**.

The trick in the riddle is that saying "one of them is not a nickel" is true - the quarter is not a nickel. The other coin is indeed a nickel.
