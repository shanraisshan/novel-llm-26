## Reasoning

Let me work through this classic riddle step by step.

The problem states:
1. I have two coins that add up to 30 cents
2. One of them is not a nickel

The key insight is in the precise wording: "One of them is not a nickel." This does not mean "neither of them is a nickel." It only tells us that ONE of the coins is not a nickel - the other coin could still be a nickel.

Let me consider the possible US coin combinations that add up to 30 cents:
- Quarter (25 cents) + Nickel (5 cents) = 30 cents
- Three dimes would be 30 cents, but that's three coins
- Six nickels would be 30 cents, but that's six coins
- 30 pennies, but that's 30 coins

The only two-coin combination that equals 30 cents is a quarter and a nickel.

Now checking the condition: "One of them is not a nickel"
- The quarter is not a nickel (this satisfies the condition)
- The nickel is a nickel

The statement "one of them is not a nickel" is true because the quarter is not a nickel. The trick of the riddle is that people often misinterpret this as "neither coin is a nickel," but that's not what it says.

## Final Answer

The two coins are a **quarter (25 cents)** and a **nickel (5 cents)**.

The riddle tricks people by saying "one of them is not a nickel" - which is true, because the quarter is not a nickel. The other coin is indeed a nickel.
