## Reasoning

This is a classic riddle that relies on careful reading of the statement.

The clue says: "One of them is not a nickel."

The trick is that this statement does NOT say "neither of them is a nickel." It only says ONE of them is not a nickel - which logically means the OTHER one CAN be a nickel.

So if one coin is a nickel (5 cents), and the two coins add up to 30 cents, then:
- 30 cents - 5 cents = 25 cents

The other coin must be worth 25 cents, which is a quarter.

Let me verify:
- A quarter (25 cents) + a nickel (5 cents) = 30 cents
- "One of them is not a nickel" - TRUE, the quarter is not a nickel
- Both conditions are satisfied

## Final Answer

The two coins are a **quarter** (25 cents) and a **nickel** (5 cents).
