## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. I am standing in a line
2. There are 3 people in front of me
3. There are 2 people behind me
4. I also need to count myself as part of the line

So the total count is:
- 3 people in front of me
- 1 person (me)
- 2 people behind me

Total: 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 people

## Final Answer

6 people are in the line.
