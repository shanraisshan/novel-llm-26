## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. I am standing in the line - that's 1 person (me)
2. There are 3 people in front of me - that's 3 people
3. There are 2 people behind me - that's 2 people

To find the total number of people in the line, I add all of these together:
- Me: 1 person
- In front of me: 3 people
- Behind me: 2 people

Total = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 people

## Final Answer

6 people are in the line.
