## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All five answers unanimously agree that there are **6 people** in the line. Every respondent correctly identified that the count must include:
- The person asking the question (yourself) = 1
- The 3 people in front = 3
- The 2 people behind = 2

Total: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6

### Areas of Disagreement
There are no disagreements. All answers arrived at the same conclusion using the same logical approach.

### Quality Assessment
All five answers demonstrate sound reasoning. The key insight that all respondents correctly identified is that "you" must be included in the total count of people in the line. This is a common trick question where some might mistakenly answer "5" by forgetting to count themselves, but all respondents avoided this error.

Answer 5 presented the calculation in a slightly different order (front to back: 3 + 1 + 2) which provides a nice visualization of the line's arrangement, though it arrives at the same answer.

## Final Synthesized Answer

There are **6 people** in the line.

The breakdown is:
- 3 people in front of you
- 1 person (yourself)
