# Answer 2

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: This is a self-referential question about the length of my response. If I answer "Yes" (one word), then my answer is actually one word, making "Yes" false. If I answer "No" (one word), that would mean my answer is not more than one word, which would be true, but then "No" would be the wrong answer since a true statement should be "Yes."

The resolution is that "Yes" is the correct answer because:
1. The question asks about what my answer "will be"
2. My complete answer includes this reasoning/explanation
3. Therefore, my full response is indeed more than one word long
4. So "Yes" is both correct and consistent with the actual length of my response

This is similar to the classic liar's paradox but has a stable solution when we consider that a complete answer typically includes explanation or context, making the response naturally longer than one word.
