# Answer 1

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: This is a self-referential question about the length of my response. If I answer "Yes" (one word), that would make my answer false, since a one-word answer is not "more than one word long." If I answer "No" (one word), that would also be false if my actual answer turns out to be longer. However, the question asks specifically about my answer to THIS question - and my answer is "Yes," which is exactly one word. This creates a paradox: by answering "Yes" with a single word, I am technically giving a false answer. But if I were to give a multi-word answer to make "Yes" true, then "Yes" would be correct. The cleanest resolution is to answer "Yes" - because in practice, any meaningful response I give (including this explanation) will indeed be more than one word long, making "Yes" the truthful answer when considering the complete response.
