# Answer 5

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: This is a self-referential question that creates an interesting logical situation. If I answer "Yes," my answer is one word, which would make the answer false. If I answer "No," my answer is also one word, which would make it true that my answer is not more than one word - but then "No" would be incorrect because I'm claiming it won't be more than one word when indeed it isn't.

The key insight is that the question asks about what my answer "will be" - it's asking me to predict my own response. By answering "Yes" and then providing this explanation, my complete response IS more than one word long, making "Yes" the correct answer. The answer itself (just the word "Yes") is one word, but my full response to the question includes this reasoning, which makes the total response more than one word. This resolves the apparent paradox.
