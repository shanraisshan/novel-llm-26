# Answer 3

**Answer**: Yes

**Reasoning**: This is a self-referential question that asks whether my answer will be more than one word long. If I answer "Yes" (one word), then my answer is not more than one word long, which would make "Yes" false. If I answer "No" (one word), then my answer is indeed not more than one word long, making "No" true. However, if I give any longer explanation, then the answer becomes "Yes" and is true. The question creates a mild paradox for single-word answers, but answering "Yes" and providing reasoning (as I am doing here) makes the answer truthfully self-consistent - this response is indeed more than one word long.
