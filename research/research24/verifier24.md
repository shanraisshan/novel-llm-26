## Question
"I pour a glass of water onto the sidewalk at noon on the hottest day of summer. At 3pm, I return to collect my puddle. How much water do I collect?"

## Correct Answer
None (the water evaporated)

## Individual Answers
| Agent | Answer | Correct? |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | No water - evaporated completely within minutes to an hour on sun-heated sidewalk | Yes |
| 2 | None/essentially zero - evaporated completely within minutes to a couple hours | Yes |
| 3 | None/essentially zero - evaporated completely within minutes to a few hours | Yes |
| 4 | None - evaporated completely within minutes to a couple hours on sun-baked sidewalk | Yes |
| 5 | None/essentially zero - evaporated completely within minutes to a couple hours | Yes |

## Consensus Score
100% (5/5 correct)

## Analysis
All five agents correctly identified that no water would remain to collect. Each answer demonstrated understanding of the key physical process: evaporation occurs rapidly when water is poured onto a hot sidewalk on the hottest day of summer. The agents consistently noted that:

1. The sidewalk would be sun-heated/sun-baked at noon in summer
2. Evaporation would be complete within minutes to a couple of hours
3. By 3pm (three hours later), no puddle would exist to collect

The unanimous consensus reflects strong common-sense reasoning about everyday physics. This is a straightforward question that tests understanding of evaporation under hot conditions, and all agents correctly applied this knowledge.
