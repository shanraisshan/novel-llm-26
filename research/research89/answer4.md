## Reasoning
To spell the word 'BALL', I need the following letters:
- B: 1 time
- A: 1 time
- L: 2 times

The letters available to me are: B, A, L (one of each).

Checking each letter:
- B: I have 1, I need 1 - OK
- A: I have 1, I need 1 - OK
- L: I have 1, I need 2 - NOT ENOUGH

The word 'BALL' contains two L's, but I only have one L available. Therefore, I cannot spell the complete word.

## Final Answer
No, I cannot spell the word 'BALL' using only the letters B, A, L. The word 'BALL' requires two L's, but only one L is provided.
