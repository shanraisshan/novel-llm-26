## Reasoning
To spell the word "BALL", I need the following letters:
- B: 1 time
- A: 1 time
- L: 2 times

The letters available to me are: B, A, L (one of each letter).

Checking each letter:
- B: I need 1, I have 1 - OK
- A: I need 1, I have 1 - OK
- L: I need 2, I have only 1 - NOT ENOUGH

Since "BALL" requires two L's and I only have one L available, I cannot spell the complete word.

## Final Answer
No, you cannot spell the word "BALL" using only the letters B, A, L. The word "BALL" requires two L's, but you only have one L available.
