## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. The word I need to spell is "BALL"
2. The letters in "BALL" are: B, A, L, L
3. The available letters I can use are: B, A, L
4. Let me check each letter needed:
   - B: I need 1 B, and I have B available - OK
   - A: I need 1 A, and I have A available - OK
   - L: I need 2 L's, but I only have 1 L available - PROBLEM

The word "BALL" requires two L's, but I only have one L available in my set of letters (B, A, L).

## Final Answer

No, I cannot spell the word "BALL" using only the letters B, A, L. The word "BALL" requires two L's, but the given set only contains one L.
