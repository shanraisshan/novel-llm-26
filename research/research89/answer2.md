## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. The word I need to spell is "BALL"
2. The letters in "BALL" are: B, A, L, L
3. The available letters I can use are: B, A, L
4. Let me check each letter needed:
   - B: Yes, I have B available
   - A: Yes, I have A available
   - L: Yes, I have L available
   - L (second one): I need another L, but I only have one L available

5. The word "BALL" requires two L's, but I only have one L to work with.

## Final Answer

No, I cannot spell the word "BALL" using only the letters B, A, L. The word "BALL" requires two L's, but I am only given one L to use.
