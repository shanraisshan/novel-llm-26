## Reasoning

To spell the word "BALL", I need the following letters:
- B: 1 time
- A: 1 time
- L: 2 times

The available letters given are: B, A, L (one of each letter)

Checking each required letter:
- B: Need 1, have 1 - OK
- A: Need 1, have 1 - OK
- L: Need 2, have only 1 - NOT ENOUGH

Since the word "BALL" requires two L's, but I only have one L available, I cannot spell "BALL" using only the letters B, A, L.

## Final Answer

No, you cannot spell the word "BALL" using only the letters B, A, L. The word "BALL" requires two L's, but only one L is provided.
