# Previous Research Summary (Iteration 37)

## Question Attempted
"If you turn the word 'MOM' upside down, what do you see?"

## Score Achieved
80% consensus (4/5 correct, 1 hedged)

## THIS IS OUR BEST RESULT SINCE RETURNING TO STRAWBERRY PARADIGM!

### Why It Worked
- Visual transformation questions require **perceptual knowledge** (M upside-down = W)
- This knowledge CANNOT be enumerated like letter counting
- This knowledge CANNOT be aligned like decimal comparison
- One model hedged between "MOM" (ambigram) and "WOW" (transformation)

### Key Insight
**Visual/spatial/perceptual questions show the most promise** because:
1. LLMs have inconsistent encoding of visual letter properties
2. Questions require factual knowledge about shapes, not reasoning
3. Chain-of-thought cannot "verify" visual properties

## What Failed (100% Consensus - Too Easy)
- Iteration 35: Letter counting in "possess" → models enumerate
- Iteration 36: Decimal comparison 3.11 vs 3.7 → models align decimal places

## Next Direction: MORE VISUAL TRANSFORMATION QUESTIONS

Build on the success of MOM→WOW. Try:
1. **Other letter rotations** - Which letters look like other letters when rotated?
2. **Mirror transformations** - What word do you see in a mirror?
3. **Letter shape properties** - Holes, symmetry, visual patterns
4. **Ambigrams** - Words that look like other words when flipped

## The 5-Year-Old Test
The question must still be instantly answerable by a human child.
Visual questions pass this test - kids can imagine flipping/rotating.
