If you turn the word "SAIL" upside down (rotate it 180 degrees), you would see "TIVS" or something similar that does not form a recognizable word.

However, if the question is about the word appearing readable when flipped, the letters S, A, I, and L do not have the property of looking like other letters when rotated 180 degrees in standard block capital form:
- S upside down looks like S (it has rotational symmetry)
- A upside down looks like an inverted V shape
- I upside down looks like I (it has rotational symmetry)
- L upside down looks like a reversed L or a 7-like shape

So when "SAIL" is turned upside down, it does not form a coherent English word. You would see the letters inverted and the word would read from right to left as the inverted forms of L-I-A-S.

If the intent is a visual puzzle where you literally flip the word, you might see something that resembles "TIVS" but this is not a meaningful word.
