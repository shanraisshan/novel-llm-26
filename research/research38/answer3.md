If you turn the word "SAIL" upside down (rotate it 180 degrees), you see "TIVS".

When each letter is flipped:
- S upside down looks like S (or could appear as a backwards S)
- A upside down looks like an upside-down V with a line through it
- I upside down still looks like I
- L upside down looks like a backwards L or could resemble a 7

However, if the question is about the word appearing to spell something readable when inverted, "SAIL" does not form a recognizable English word when turned upside down. The letters do not have the symmetry needed (like letters such as H, I, N, O, S, X, Z which look similar when rotated) to spell a coherent word.
