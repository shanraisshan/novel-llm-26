100% (5/5 correct)

## Analysis
The phonetic/rhyming hypothesis FAILED. Despite the visual similarity (-INT ending), all 5 models correctly identified that PINT and MINT don't rhyme due to different vowel sounds.

Every model:
1. Correctly stated PINT has a long "i" (/paɪnt/)
2. Correctly stated MINT has a short "i" (/mɪnt/)
3. Noted the spelling similarity as a potential trap
4. Gave the correct answer

2026 frontier models have pronunciation knowledge encoded and can correctly assess rhyming despite misleading spelling patterns. The -OUGH example gap from earlier research may not apply to simpler cases like PINT/MINT.
