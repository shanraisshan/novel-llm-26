# Does PINT rhyme with MINT?

## Reasoning

To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their ending sounds (the vowel and any consonants that follow it in the final syllable).

- **PINT**: Pronounced /paɪnt/ - the vowel sound is a long "i" (the diphthong /aɪ/ as in "eye")
- **MINT**: Pronounced /mɪnt/ - the vowel sound is a short "i" (/ɪ/ as in "sit")

While both words end in "-int" when spelled, they have different vowel sounds:
- PINT has the long "i" sound (rhymes with "wine," "dine," "fine")
- MINT has the short "i" sound (rhymes with "hint," "print," "sprint")

## Final Answer

**No, PINT does not rhyme with MINT.**

Despite their similar spelling, the words have different vowel sounds. PINT is one of those irregular English words where the spelling does not match the expected pronunciation pattern. Words that truly rhyme with PINT include: dint (archaic), but more commonly it rhymes with words ending in the "-ine" sound pattern when considering near rhymes.
