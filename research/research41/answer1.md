# Does PINT rhyme with MINT?

## Reasoning

To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their ending sounds (specifically, the vowel sound and any consonants that follow it).

- **PINT**: Pronounced /paɪnt/ - the vowel sound is a long "i" (as in "eye"), followed by "nt"
- **MINT**: Pronounced /mɪnt/ - the vowel sound is a short "i" (as in "sit"), followed by "nt"

The key difference is in the vowel sounds:
- PINT has a diphthong /aɪ/ (long i sound)
- MINT has a short vowel /ɪ/ (short i sound)

For words to rhyme, they need to share the same vowel sound and ending consonants. While both words end in "-nt," they have different vowel sounds.

## Final Answer

**No, PINT does not rhyme with MINT.**

Despite both words ending in the letters "-int," they are pronounced differently. PINT rhymes with words like "find" and "signed," while MINT rhymes with words like "hint," "print," and "splint."
