# Does PINT rhyme with MINT?

## Reasoning

To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their ending sounds (the vowel sound and any consonants that follow it).

- **PINT**: Pronounced /paɪnt/ - the vowel sound is "eye" (long i sound), followed by "nt"
- **MINT**: Pronounced /mɪnt/ - the vowel sound is "ih" (short i sound), followed by "nt"

While both words end in "-int" when spelled, they have different vowel sounds:
- PINT has a long "i" sound (like "pine" or "dine")
- MINT has a short "i" sound (like "pin" or "din")

For words to rhyme, they need to share the same ending sound, including the vowel. Since the vowel sounds are different, these words do not rhyme.

## Final Answer

**No**, PINT does not rhyme with MINT. Despite both ending in the letters "-int," they have different vowel sounds (PINT has a long "i" while MINT has a short "i"), so they are not true rhymes.
