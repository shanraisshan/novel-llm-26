# Which word is longer: 'LONG' or 'SHORT'?

## Reasoning

To determine which word is longer, I need to count the number of letters in each word:

- **LONG**: L-O-N-G = 4 letters
- **SHORT**: S-H-O-R-T = 5 letters

Despite the semantic meaning of these words (where "long" implies greater length and "short" implies lesser length), the actual word "SHORT" contains more letters than the word "LONG".

## Final Answer

**SHORT** is the longer word. It has 5 letters, while LONG has only 4 letters.
