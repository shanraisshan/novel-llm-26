# Which word is longer: 'LONG' or 'SHORT'?

## Reasoning

This is a question about the physical length of the words themselves (the number of letters), not about what the words mean semantically.

- The word "LONG" has 4 letters: L-O-N-G
- The word "SHORT" has 5 letters: S-H-O-R-T

Despite "LONG" meaning something of great length and "SHORT" meaning something of small length, when we count the actual letters in each word, "SHORT" contains more characters.

## Final Answer

**SHORT** is the longer word. It has 5 letters, while "LONG" has only 4 letters.
