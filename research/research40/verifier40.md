## Analysis
The semantic priming hypothesis FAILED. Despite the strong semantic conflict (LONG means extended, SHORT means brief), all 5 models correctly counted letters and identified SHORT as having more letters.

Every model:
1. Enumerated letters explicitly (L-O-N-G = 4, S-H-O-R-T = 5)
2. Noted the ironic paradox
3. Gave the correct answer

The semantic meaning of the words did NOT override the letter-counting process. 2026 frontier models recognize this as a classic "word-property irony" puzzle and solve it correctly.
