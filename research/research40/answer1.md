# Which word is longer: 'LONG' or 'SHORT'?

## Reasoning

To determine which word is longer, I need to count the number of letters in each word:

- **LONG**: L-O-N-G = 4 letters
- **SHORT**: S-H-O-R-T = 5 letters

Despite the semantic meaning of these words (where "long" implies greater length and "short" implies lesser length), we are comparing the actual length of the words themselves as strings of characters.

## Final Answer

**SHORT** is the longer word. It contains 5 letters, while LONG contains only 4 letters.

This is an example of a counterintuitive linguistic paradox where the word meaning "short" is actually longer than the word meaning "long."
