# Which word is longer: 'LONG' or 'SHORT'?

## Reasoning

To determine which word is longer, I need to count the number of letters in each word:

- **LONG**: L-O-N-G = 4 letters
- **SHORT**: S-H-O-R-T = 5 letters

Despite the semantic meaning of the words (where "long" implies greater length and "short" implies lesser length), we are comparing the actual length of the words themselves as strings of characters.

## Final Answer

**SHORT** is the longer word. It has 5 letters, while LONG has only 4 letters.

This is an example of a counterintuitive situation where the word meaning "brief" or "not long" is actually longer than the word meaning "extended" or "not short."
