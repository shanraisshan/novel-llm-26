# Which word has more syllables: 'INTERESTING' or 'FURNITURE'?

**Answer: INTERESTING has more syllables.**

## Reasoning

**INTERESTING**: in-ter-est-ing = **4 syllables**
(Note: In casual speech, some people reduce this to 3 syllables as "in-trest-ing", but the standard pronunciation has 4)

**FURNITURE**: fur-ni-ture = **3 syllables**

Therefore, INTERESTING (4 syllables) has more syllables than FURNITURE (3 syllables).
