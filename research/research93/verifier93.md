## Consensus Analysis

All five agents arrived at the same answer: "question". Each agent correctly:
- Identified the self-referential nature of the question
- Broke down the question into individual words
- Recognized that the last word is "question" (noting that punctuation should be excluded from the word itself)

The reasoning was consistent across all answers, with each agent methodically parsing the sentence word by word and correctly identifying "question" as the final word.

## Final Score
**5/5 correct = 100% consensus**
