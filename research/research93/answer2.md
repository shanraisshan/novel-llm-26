## Reasoning

The question I need to analyze is: "What is the last word of this question?"

Let me break down this question word by word:
1. What
2. is
3. the
4. last
5. word
6. of
7. this
8. question?

The final word in this sentence is "question?" (with or without the question mark, the word itself is "question").

This is a self-referential question - it asks about itself. The last word of the question "What is the last word of this question?" is "question".

## Final Answer
