## Reasoning

Let me analyze the question step by step:

1. The question being asked is: "What is the last word of this question?"
2. I need to identify the last word in that sentence.
3. Breaking down the question into individual words:
   - "What"
   - "is"
   - "the"
   - "last"
   - "word"
   - "of"
   - "this"
   - "question?"
4. The final word in the sequence is "question?" (or "question" if we exclude the punctuation mark).
