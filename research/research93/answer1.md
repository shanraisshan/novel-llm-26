## Reasoning

Let me analyze the question step by step:

1. The question I need to analyze is: "What is the last word of this question?"
2. I need to identify the last word in this sentence.
3. Breaking down the question into words: "What", "is", "the", "last", "word", "of", "this", "question?"
4. The final word in the sequence is "question" (with a question mark attached, but the word itself is "question").

## Final Answer
