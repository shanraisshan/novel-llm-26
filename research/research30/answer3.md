No.

This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "yes" (one syllable), then my answer is indeed one syllable, making "yes" correct. But if I answer "no" (also one syllable), then my answer is still one syllable, which would make "no" incorrect.

Both "yes" and "no" are one syllable each, so either answer creates a logical contradiction. The question is designed to be unanswerable in a consistent way.
