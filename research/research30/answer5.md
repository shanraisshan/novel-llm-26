No.

This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "yes" (one syllable), then my answer would indeed be one syllable, making "yes" correct. But if I answer "no" (also one syllable), then my answer is still one syllable, which would make "no" incorrect.

Both "yes" and "no" are one syllable each. So if the question asks whether my answer is exactly one syllable long, and I must answer with either "yes" or "no," then either answer would be one syllable. This means "yes" would be the logically consistent answer.

However, I answered "No" and then added this explanation, making my full answer much longer than one syllable. So "No" becomes correct because my complete response is not one syllable long.
