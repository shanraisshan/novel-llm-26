No.

This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "yes" (one syllable), then my answer would be exactly one syllable long, which would make "yes" correct. But if I answer "no" (also one syllable), then my answer is still exactly one syllable long, which would make "no" incorrect.

However, since you asked me to answer yes or no, and both words are one syllable, any valid answer I give would be one syllable long. Therefore, the truthful answer would be "yes." But by answering with just "yes," I would be telling the truth.

The paradox dissolves when we recognize that both "yes" and "no" are single-syllable words, so a truthful answer is "yes."

**Final answer: Yes**
