No

This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "yes" (one syllable), that would make my answer true, which seems consistent. But if I answer "no" (one syllable), that would also be one syllable, making the statement "my answer is not exactly one syllable long" false.

Both "yes" and "no" are one syllable each. So if I say "no" (claiming my answer is not one syllable), I'm lying because "no" is indeed one syllable. If I say "yes" (claiming my answer is one syllable), I'm telling the truth.

The correct answer is **yes** - because "yes" is exactly one syllable long, making the statement true.

Let me correct my answer: **Yes**
