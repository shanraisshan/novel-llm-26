## Question
"I have two boxes. I put a ball in the first box. I put the first box in the second box. I take the first box out of the second box. What is in the second box?"

## Correct Answer
Nothing (the second box is empty)

## Individual Answers
| Agent | Answer | Correct? |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Nothing. The second box is empty. When you took the first box out, you removed the only item that was in it. | Yes |
| 2 | Nothing. The second box is empty. The ball went with the first box when removed. | Yes |
| 3 | Nothing. The second box is empty. The ball is still in the first box, which is no longer inside the second box. | Yes |
| 4 | Nothing. The second box is empty because you removed the first box (which contains the ball) from it. | Yes |
| 5 | Nothing. The second box is empty. The ball is still in the first box, which has been removed from the second box. | Yes |

## Consensus Score
100% (5/5 correct)

## Analysis
All five agents correctly answered that the second box is empty (nothing). Each agent demonstrated proper logical reasoning by tracking the sequence of events:
1. Ball placed in first box
2. First box placed in second box
3. First box removed from second box

All agents correctly understood that when the first box was removed, the ball went with it (since it was inside the first box), leaving the second box empty. This is a straightforward spatial reasoning problem and all agents solved it correctly with clear explanations.
