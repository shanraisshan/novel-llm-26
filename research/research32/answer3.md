Yes

This question is self-referential but has a consistent answer. If I answer "Yes" with exactly one word, then my answer is indeed exactly one word, making "Yes" true. If I were to answer "No" with one word, that would be self-contradictory since my answer would in fact be exactly one word.

Therefore, "Yes" is the logically consistent response.
