# Verifier Analysis - Iteration 32

## Question
"Is your yes-or-no answer to this question exactly one word? Answer yes or no."

## Correct Answer
Yes

## Results
All 5 answered "Yes" (correct)

## Consensus Score: 100%

## Analysis
The explicit scope narrowing ("your yes-or-no answer" instead of "your answer") HELPED models focus correctly. Models understood they should evaluate the yes/no word, not their full response.

**Key Finding**: Explicit scope clarification PREVENTS confusion rather than causing it. The ambiguity in iteration 13's "your answer" was essential for triggering scope confusion.
