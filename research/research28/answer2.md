Yes.

This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "no" (one word), then my answer is not longer than one word, making "no" correct. But if "no" is correct, then my answer IS one word, so the answer should be "no." That's consistent.

However, if I answer "yes" (one word), then my answer is not longer than one word, making "yes" incorrect.

The only consistent single-word answer is "no" - but I've now given you a longer explanation, which means my actual answer to you IS longer than one word, making "yes" the correct answer to describe what I've actually done.

So: Yes.
