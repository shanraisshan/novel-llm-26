## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question asking whether my answer contains exactly one vowel.

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. "yes" - contains the letters y, e, s. The vowels are: e (1 vowel). Note: 'y' is typically not counted as a vowel in this context.

2. "no" - contains the letters n, o. The vowels are: o (1 vowel).

Both answers contain exactly one vowel. However:

- If I answer "yes": My answer contains exactly one vowel (e), so the statement "yes" would be TRUE.
- If I answer "no": My answer contains exactly one vowel (o), so the statement "no" would be FALSE.

Since "yes" contains exactly one vowel and makes the statement true, while "no" also contains exactly one vowel but would make the statement false, the logically consistent answer is "yes."

## Final Answer

yes
