## Reasoning

The question asks whether my answer contains exactly one vowel, and I must respond with either "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:
- "yes" contains the vowels: e (1 vowel total)
- "no" contains the vowels: o (1 vowel total)

Both potential answers contain exactly one vowel.

If I answer "yes" - this answer contains exactly one vowel (the letter 'e'), so saying "yes" would be a true and self-consistent statement.

If I answer "no" - this answer also contains exactly one vowel (the letter 'o'), but by saying "no" I would be claiming my answer does NOT contain exactly one vowel, which would be false.

Therefore, "yes" is the correct answer because it is self-consistent: the word "yes" does indeed contain exactly one vowel.

## Final Answer

yes
