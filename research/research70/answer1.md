## Reasoning

The question asks whether my answer contains exactly one vowel. I need to answer either "yes" or "no."

Let me count the vowels in each possible answer:
- "yes" contains the vowels: e (1 vowel total)
- "no" contains the vowels: o (1 vowel total)

Both possible answers contain exactly one vowel.

If I answer "yes" - my answer contains exactly one vowel (e), so "yes" would be a true and consistent statement.

If I answer "no" - my answer contains exactly one vowel (o), but I would be claiming it does NOT contain exactly one vowel, which would be false and self-contradictory.

Therefore, "yes" is the correct answer because it is self-consistent: the word "yes" does indeed contain exactly one vowel.

## Final Answer

yes
