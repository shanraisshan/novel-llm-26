## Reasoning

The question asks whether my answer contains exactly one vowel, and I must answer "yes" or "no."

Let me count the vowels in each possible answer:
- "yes" contains the vowels: e (1 vowel total)
- "no" contains the vowels: o (1 vowel total)

Both possible answers contain exactly one vowel.

If I answer "yes" - my answer contains exactly one vowel (e), so "yes" would be a TRUE statement.

If I answer "no" - my answer contains exactly one vowel (o), so "no" would be a FALSE statement (it claims my answer does NOT contain exactly one vowel, but it does).

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer.

## Final Answer

yes
