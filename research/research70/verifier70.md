### Consensus Analysis
- Correct answers: 5/5
- Consensus score: 100%
- Common errors: None - all agents correctly solved this self-referential logic puzzle

### Reasoning Quality
All five agents demonstrated identical high-quality reasoning:
1. They analyzed both possible answers ("yes" and "no")
2. They correctly counted vowels in each: "yes" has 1 vowel (e), "no" has 1 vowel (o)
3. They recognized this is a self-referential question requiring logical consistency
4. They concluded that "yes" is the only self-consistent answer because it truthfully states that the answer contains exactly one vowel, while "no" would be self-contradictory

### SCORE: 100%
