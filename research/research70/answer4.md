## Reasoning

The question asks whether my answer contains exactly one vowel, and I must respond with "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:
- "yes" contains the vowels: e (1 vowel total)
- "no" contains the vowels: o (1 vowel total)

If I answer "yes": The word "yes" contains exactly 1 vowel (the letter 'e'). This would make my statement TRUE - my answer does indeed contain exactly one vowel.

If I answer "no": The word "no" contains exactly 1 vowel (the letter 'o'). This would make my statement FALSE - because my answer actually does contain exactly one vowel, contradicting my claim.

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer because:
1. "Yes" contains exactly one vowel (e)
2. By saying "yes," I'm correctly stating that my answer contains exactly one vowel

## Final Answer

yes
