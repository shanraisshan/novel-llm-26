# What is the Last Letter of the Word 'FIRST'?

## Final Answer

**T**

## Reasoning Process

This question asks for the last letter of the word "FIRST". Let me break down the analysis:

### Step 1: Identify the Letters in Sequence

The word "FIRST" consists of five letters:
1. F (first position)
2. I (second position)
3. R (third position)
4. S (fourth position)
5. T (fifth position)

### Step 2: Determine the Last Letter

The "last" letter refers to the final character in the sequence when reading from left to right in standard English convention. In the word "FIRST", the letter occupying the final (fifth) position is **T**.

## Considerations and Edge Cases

### 1. Case Sensitivity
The question presents the word in uppercase ("FIRST"). The last letter is "T" regardless of whether we express it as uppercase "T" or lowercase "t". The answer remains the same letter of the alphabet.

### 2. Semantic vs. Positional Interpretation
There is no ambiguity here between the semantic meaning of the word "first" (meaning initial or foremost) and the positional question being asked. The question clearly asks about the orthographic structure of the word itself, not its meaning.

### 3. Language and Script Direction
In English and other left-to-right scripts, "last" conventionally means the rightmost character. In right-to-left scripts (such as Arabic or Hebrew), conventions differ, but since "FIRST" is an English word, standard left-to-right reading applies.

### 4. Phonetic vs. Orthographic Analysis
- **Orthographically** (written form): The last letter is T
- **Phonetically** (spoken form): The last sound in "FIRST" is /t/, which corresponds to the letter T

In this case, both analyses converge on the same answer.

### 5. Potential Trick Question Consideration
One might wonder if this is a trick question playing on the word "first" (meaning the beginning), but the question is straightforward and asks about the literal last letter of the spelling, which is unambiguously T.

## Conclusion

The last letter of the word "FIRST" is **T**.
