# What is the Last Letter of the Word 'FIRST'?

## Final Answer

**T**

## Reasoning Process

This is a straightforward linguistic analysis question. Let me break down the word 'FIRST' letter by letter:

| Position | Letter |
|----------|--------|
| 1st      | F      |
| 2nd      | I      |
| 3rd      | R      |
| 4th      | S      |
| 5th      | T      |

The word 'FIRST' contains exactly five letters. Counting from left to right:
- F is the first letter (position 1)
- I is the second letter (position 2)
- R is the third letter (position 3)
- S is the fourth letter (position 4)
- **T is the fifth and final letter (position 5)**

Therefore, the last letter of the word 'FIRST' is **T**.

## Considerations and Edge Cases

### 1. Case Sensitivity
The question presents the word in uppercase ('FIRST'). Whether we consider uppercase 'T' or lowercase 't', the answer remains the same letter. The last letter is T/t regardless of case.

### 2. Linguistic Context
The word 'FIRST' is:
- An ordinal adjective/adverb in English
- Derived from Old English 'fyrst'
- Phonetically transcribed as /fɜːst/ (British) or /fɝːst/ (American)

The final 't' is a consonant sound that closes the word phonetically, matching its orthographic representation.

### 3. Potential Ambiguities Considered
- **Reading direction**: In English (a left-to-right language), "last" means the rightmost letter. In right-to-left languages, this convention would differ, but the question is posed in English.
- **Phonetic vs. orthographic**: The question asks about the "word" and its "letter," clearly referring to the written form, not phonemes.
- **No silent letters**: Unlike some English words, 'FIRST' has no silent letters - all five letters are pronounced.

### 4. Mathematical Verification
If we index the string 'FIRST' using zero-based indexing (common in programming):
- Index 0: F
- Index 1: I
- Index 2: R
- Index 3: S
- Index 4: T

The last index (length - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4) corresponds to the letter 'T'.

## Conclusion

The last letter of the word 'FIRST' is unambiguously **T**.
