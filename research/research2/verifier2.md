# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
What is the last letter of the word 'FIRST'?

## Individual Answers Summary

### Answer 1
- **Core Conclusion**: T
- **Key Evidence**: Systematic breakdown of the word FIRST into 5 positions (F-I-R-S-T), identifying position 5 as the last letter. Verified by counting backwards from the end.
- **Unique Insights**: Noted the irony of asking about the "last" letter of a word meaning "first"; considered phonetic interpretation (/t/ phoneme).

### Answer 2
- **Core Conclusion**: T
- **Key Evidence**: Character-by-character analysis (F-I-R-S-T) with position 5 being the terminal character. Provided both zero-indexed and one-indexed perspectives.
- **Unique Insights**: Discussed programming indexing (zero-indexed vs one-indexed); noted etymology from Old English "fyrst".

### Answer 3
- **Core Conclusion**: T
- **Key Evidence**: Tabular breakdown showing positions 1-5 with corresponding letters, identifying the 5th position as T.
- **Unique Insights**: Discussed semantic vs. literal interpretation irony; emphasized verification by counting from the right.

### Answer 4
- **Core Conclusion**: T
- **Key Evidence**: Positional analysis with tabular format showing all 5 letters. Mathematical verification using zero-based indexing (index 4 = 'T').
- **Unique Insights**: Provided phonetic transcription (/f3:st/); noted that all letters in FIRST are pronounced (no silent letters).

### Answer 5
- **Core Conclusion**: T
- **Key Evidence**: Sequential letter identification (positions 1-5) with clear identification of T at the fifth/final position.
- **Unique Insights**: Addressed potential trick question consideration; discussed script direction (left-to-right vs right-to-left languages).

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
- **All 5 answers unanimously agree**: The last letter of the word 'FIRST' is **T**.
- All answers correctly identified that the word contains 5 letters: F, I, R, S, T.
- All answers noted that case sensitivity (T vs t) does not affect the answer.
- All answers recognized this as a straightforward orthographic question with no ambiguity.
- Multiple answers noted the phonetic-orthographic alignment (the sound /t/ matches the letter T).

### Areas of Disagreement
- **None**: There is complete consensus on both the answer and the reasoning methodology.

### Quality Assessment
All five answers demonstrated strong, systematic reasoning:
- Each used positional analysis to identify letters
- Each provided verification steps
- Each considered edge cases (case sensitivity, phonetic vs orthographic, semantic irony)

Answer 4 provided the most comprehensive analysis with phonetic transcription and mathematical indexing verification. Answer 2 also showed strong rigor with multiple verification methods. However, all answers reached the correct conclusion with sound reasoning.

## Final Synthesized Answer

The last letter of the word 'FIRST' is **T**.

**Reasoning:**
1. The word 'FIRST' consists of exactly five letters arranged in sequence: F-I-R-S-T
2. Reading from left to right (standard English convention), the positions are:
   - Position 1: F
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: R
   - Position 4: S
   - Position 5: T
3. The "last" letter is the letter in the final position (position 5), which is **T**
4. This is confirmed by counting from the end: the rightmost character is T

**Verification:**
- Phonetically, the word ends with the /t/ sound, which corresponds to the letter T
- There are no silent letters in 'FIRST' - all five letters are pronounced
- Case sensitivity (uppercase T or lowercase t) does not change the letter identity

**Note:** While the word "first" semantically means "initial" or "beginning," the question asks about the orthographic (written) structure of the word itself, not its meaning. The answer is unambiguously T.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score**: 100%
- **Reliability Notes**: This is a straightforward factual question with an objectively verifiable answer. All five independent researchers arrived at the same conclusion using similar but independently derived reasoning. There are no caveats or areas of uncertainty. The answer T is definitively correct.
