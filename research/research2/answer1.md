# What is the Last Letter of the Word 'FIRST'?

## Final Answer

**T**

## Reasoning Process

The question asks for the last letter of the word 'FIRST'. This is a straightforward linguistic analysis task.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the word**: FIRST
2. **Break down the letters in order**:
   - Position 1: F
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: R
   - Position 4: S
   - Position 5: T
3. **Identify the final position**: The word contains 5 letters, so the last letter is at position 5.
4. **Extract the answer**: The letter at position 5 is **T**.

## Considerations and Edge Cases

### Case Sensitivity
The word was presented in uppercase ('FIRST'), so the last letter could be expressed as either 'T' (uppercase) or 't' (lowercase). The answer remains the same letter regardless of case representation.

### Linguistic Context
- The word "first" is an ordinal adjective/adverb derived from Old English "fyrst"
- It functions as an ordinal number indicating position at the beginning of a sequence
- Interestingly, there is a subtle irony in the question: we are asked about the *last* letter of a word that means *first*

### Alternative Interpretations Considered
1. **Phonetic interpretation**: If asking about the last *sound* rather than letter, the answer would be the phoneme /t/, which corresponds to the letter T.
2. **Semantic interpretation**: The question is unambiguous - it asks about orthographic representation (spelling), not meaning.

### Verification
Counting backwards from the end:
- Last letter (position -1): T
- Second to last (position -2): S
- Third to last (position -3): R
- Fourth to last (position -4): I
- Fifth to last (position -5): F

This confirms the answer is **T**.
