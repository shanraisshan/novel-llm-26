# What is the Last Letter of the Word 'FIRST'?

## Final Answer

**T**

## Reasoning Process

This is a straightforward linguistic question that requires identifying the final character in a sequence of letters.

The word 'FIRST' consists of five letters arranged in the following order:

| Position | Letter |
|----------|--------|
| 1st | F |
| 2nd | I |
| 3rd | R |
| 4th | S |
| 5th (last) | T |

The last letter—the one occupying the final position in the sequence—is **T**.

## Considerations and Edge Cases

### 1. Case Sensitivity
The question presents the word in uppercase ('FIRST'). Whether we consider the answer to be 'T' (uppercase) or 't' (lowercase) depends on context. Both represent the same letter of the alphabet. I have provided the answer in uppercase to match the format of the question.

### 2. Semantic vs. Literal Interpretation
One might humorously note that the word "first" refers to something at the beginning, yet we are asked about its end. This creates a mild irony but does not affect the answer—we are examining the orthographic structure of the word, not its semantic meaning.

### 3. Phonetic Consideration
In terms of pronunciation, the word ends with the /t/ sound, which corresponds directly to the letter T. There is no silent letter or phonetic ambiguity here.

### 4. Language Context
This analysis assumes English orthography. The word 'FIRST' in English is spelled F-I-R-S-T. In other languages or transliteration systems, the representation might differ, but the question appears to be asking about the standard English spelling.

### 5. Verification Method
To verify: counting from the end of the word 'FIRST', the last (1st from right) letter is T, preceded by S, R, I, and F.
