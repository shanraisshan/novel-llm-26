# Research Question: What is the last letter of the word 'FIRST'?

## Final Answer

**T**

## Reasoning Process

This question asks for the identification of the final character in the English word "FIRST." Let me analyze this systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Word Components

The word "FIRST" consists of five letters arranged in sequence:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T

### Step 2: Determine the Last Letter

The "last letter" refers to the letter in the final position of the word. In "FIRST," this is the letter at position 5, which is **T**.

### Step 3: Verification

Reading the word character by character: F-I-R-S-T

The terminal character is unambiguously **T**.

## Considerations and Edge Cases

### 1. Case Sensitivity
The question presents the word in uppercase ("FIRST"). The last letter is "T" regardless of whether we consider it as uppercase "T" or lowercase "t". The letter identity remains the same; only the typographical representation differs.

### 2. Linguistic Context
"First" is an ordinal adjective/adverb in English, derived from Old English "fyrst." The spelling has been standardized for centuries, so there are no variant spellings to consider.

### 3. Potential Ambiguities Considered
- **Phonetic vs. orthographic interpretation**: The question asks about the "letter," which is an orthographic (written) concept, not a phonetic one. The last sound /t/ corresponds directly to the last letter "T" in this case.
- **Unicode or encoding issues**: In standard English text, "FIRST" contains no special characters or diacritics that could complicate identification.

### 4. Mathematical/Indexing Perspective
In zero-indexed systems (common in programming), the last letter would be at index 4. In one-indexed systems (natural counting), it would be at position 5. Either way, the letter itself is **T**.

## Conclusion

The last letter of the word "FIRST" is definitively **T**. This is a straightforward orthographic question with an unambiguous answer.
