## Reasoning

I need to subtract the amount spent from the starting amount.

Starting amount: $9.90 (nine dollars and ninety cents)
Amount spent: $9.11 (nine dollars and eleven cents)

Calculation:
- $9.90 - $9.11
- Breaking it down: 9 dollars minus 9 dollars = 0 dollars
- 90 cents minus 11 cents = 79 cents

$9.90 - $9.11 = $0.79

## Final Answer

79 cents (or $0.79)
