## Reasoning

I need to subtract the amount spent from the starting amount.

- Starting amount: $9.90 (nine dollars and ninety cents)
- Amount spent: $9.11 (nine dollars and eleven cents)

Calculation:
$9.90 - $9.11 = $0.79

Breaking it down:
- Dollars: 9 - 9 = 0 dollars
- Cents: 90 - 11 = 79 cents

## Final Answer

79 cents (or $0.79)
