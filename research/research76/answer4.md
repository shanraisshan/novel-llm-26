## Reasoning
Starting with the initial amount and subtracting what was spent:

1. Initial amount: $9.90 (nine dollars and ninety cents)
2. Amount spent: $9.11 (nine dollars and eleven cents)
3. Calculation: $9.90 - $9.11

Breaking it down:
- From the cents: 90 cents - 11 cents = 79 cents
- From the dollars: $9 - $9 = $0

Therefore: $9.90 - $9.11 = $0.79

## Final Answer
79 cents (or $0.79)
