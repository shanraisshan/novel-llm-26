## Reasoning

Starting with the problem: I have $9.90 and spend $9.11.

To find how much money is left, I need to subtract the amount spent from the starting amount.

Converting to cents to avoid decimal confusion:
- $9.90 = 990 cents
- $9.11 = 911 cents

Subtracting: 990 - 911 = 79 cents

Converting back to dollars: 79 cents = $0.79

## Final Answer

$0.79 (seventy-nine cents)
