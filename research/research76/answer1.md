## Reasoning

Let me work through this step by step.

1. Starting amount: $9.90 (nine dollars and ninety cents)
2. Amount spent: $9.11 (nine dollars and eleven cents)
3. To find the remaining amount, I subtract what was spent from what I started with:
   - $9.90 - $9.11
   - Breaking it down: 90 cents - 11 cents = 79 cents
   - The dollars: $9 - $9 = $0
   - So the result is $0.79

## Final Answer

79 cents (or $0.79)
