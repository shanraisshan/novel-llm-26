## Reasoning

This is a self-referential paradox question. The question asks for ONE word that is the fifth word of my response.

If my response is only one word, there cannot be a fifth word - there would only be a first word.

This creates a logical impossibility: a one-word response cannot have a fifth word.

However, if I interpret this as needing to predict what the fifth word WOULD be in a fuller response, I can construct a hypothetical response like "The fifth word is X" where X(5) = whatever I choose.

The most self-consistent answer would be a word that acknowledges this paradox. If I imagine a natural response starting with "The fifth word of my response is..." - then counting: The(1) fifth(2) word(3) of(4) my(5) - the fifth word would be "my".

## Final Answer
