## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question that asks me to predict the fifth word of my own response while answering with just one word.

If I must answer with just ONE word, my response has only one word, meaning there is no fifth word. This creates a paradox.

However, if I construct a sentence where the answer is self-consistent, such as "The fifth word is: fifth" - then counting: "The"(1) "fifth"(2) "word"(3) "is:"(4) "fifth"(5) - the fifth word would be "fifth".

Alternatively, if I say "My response fifth word is fifth" - counting: "My"(1) "response"(2) "fifth"(3) "word"(4) "is"(5) - the fifth word is "is".

Given the constraint to answer with ONE word and make it self-referential, the most elegant solution is "fifth" - because in a sentence like "The fifth word is fifth," the fifth word is indeed "fifth."

## Final Answer
fifth
