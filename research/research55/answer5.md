## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question asking for the fifth word of my response.

If I construct a natural response like "The fifth word is X", then:
- Word 1: The
- Word 2: fifth
- Word 3: word
- Word 4: is
- Word 5: X

For consistency, if the fifth word IS my answer, and the answer needs to be "X", then X must equal the fifth word of the sentence.

If my response is "The fifth word is is", then:
- Word 5 = "is"
- And that matches what I'm claiming

This creates a self-consistent answer.

## Final Answer
is
