## Analysis
All five answerers correctly identified 3 pairs of consecutive identical letters in the word 'BOOKKEEPER'. Each answerer used the same methodical approach of examining the word letter by letter (B-O-O-K-K-E-E-P-E-R) and correctly identified the three pairs:
- OO at positions 2-3
- KK at positions 4-5
- EE at positions 6-7

Answerer 4 provided additional clarification noting that while the word contains three E's total, only two of them are consecutive (positions 6-7), with the third E (position 9) separated by the letter P. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the question's requirements.

The unanimous agreement across all answerers indicates this is a straightforward counting problem with a clear, unambiguous answer.
