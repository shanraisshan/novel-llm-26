# How Many Pairs of Consecutive Identical Letters in 'BOOKKEEPER'?

## Reasoning

Let me examine the word BOOKKEEPER letter by letter, looking for pairs of consecutive identical letters:

B-O-O-K-K-E-E-P-E-R

Position analysis:
1. B-O: different letters
2. O-O: **identical pair** (positions 2-3)
3. O-K: different letters
4. K-K: **identical pair** (positions 4-5)
5. K-E: different letters
6. E-E: **identical pair** (positions 6-7)
7. E-P: different letters
8. P-E: different letters
9. E-R: different letters

The consecutive identical letter pairs are:
- OO (the two O's)
- KK (the two K's)
- EE (the two E's in positions 6-7)

Note: The word has three E's total, but only two of them are consecutive (positions 6-7). The third E (position 9) is separated by the P.

## Final Answer

**3** pairs of consecutive identical letters.
