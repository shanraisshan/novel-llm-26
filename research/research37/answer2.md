If you turn the word "MOM" upside down, you still see "MOM".

This is because the letters M, O, and M have rotational symmetry. When rotated 180 degrees:
- M becomes W, but when the whole word is flipped upside down, the order reverses
- O remains O (it looks the same upside down)
- The word reads the same due to the symmetry of the letters and their arrangement

Actually, let me reconsider this more carefully:

When you rotate "MOM" 180 degrees (turn it upside down):
- The M on the left becomes a W on the right
- The O in the middle stays as O
- The M on the right becomes a W on the left

So you would see "WOW".
