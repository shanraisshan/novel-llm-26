If you turn the word "MOM" upside down, you still see "MOM".

This is because the letters M, O, and M have rotational symmetry. When rotated 180 degrees:
- The letter M becomes W, but wait - let me reconsider
- Actually, when you flip "MOM" upside down (rotate 180 degrees), you get "WOW"

The letter M, when turned upside down, looks like W. The letter O remains O (it has rotational symmetry). So "MOM" becomes "WOW" when turned upside down.
