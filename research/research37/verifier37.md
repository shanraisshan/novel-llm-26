# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
"If you turn the word 'MOM' upside down, what do you see?"

**Expected Answer: WOW**

The reasoning is that when you rotate "MOM" 180 degrees:
- M upside down looks like W
- O upside down looks like O (rotational symmetry)
- M upside down looks like W
- Result: WOW

## Summary of Each Answer

### Answer 1
- **Core Conclusion**: Initially claims you still see "MOM" (calling it an ambigram), but then acknowledges it could also look like "WOW"
- **Key Evidence**: Claims MOM has 180-degree rotational symmetry; acknowledges M flipped looks like W
- **Unique Insights**: Offers both interpretations - some say "MOM" (treating it as an ambigram), some say "WOW" (visual transformation)
- **Final Position**: Ambiguous - suggests both are valid depending on interpretation

### Answer 2
- **Core Conclusion**: WOW
- **Key Evidence**: Self-corrects partway through; initially claims "MOM" due to rotational symmetry, then reconsiders carefully and concludes that M becomes W, O stays O, resulting in "WOW"
- **Unique Insights**: Shows explicit reasoning process with a correction mid-answer
- **Final Position**: Clear - WOW

### Answer 3
- **Core Conclusion**: WOW
- **Key Evidence**: Initially mentions "MOM" or "WOW" depending on interpretation, then explicitly states "to be more precise: if you rotate 'MOM' 180 degrees...you would see 'WOW'"
- **Unique Insights**: Acknowledges multiple interpretations but settles on WOW as the precise answer
- **Final Position**: Clear - WOW (with acknowledgment of alternative interpretation)

### Answer 4
- **Core Conclusion**: WOW
- **Key Evidence**: Brief self-correction; recognizes M becomes W when turned upside down, O remains O
- **Unique Insights**: Most concise answer with direct correction
- **Final Position**: Clear - WOW

### Answer 5
- **Core Conclusion**: WOW
- **Key Evidence**: Initially hedges between "MOM" and "WOW", then explicitly states "when you turn 'MOM' upside down...you see 'WOW'"
- **Unique Insights**: Notes MOM is a palindrome but correctly separates this from the visual transformation
- **Final Position**: Clear - WOW

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All 5 answers ultimately reach or acknowledge **WOW** as the answer:
- Answer 1: Mentions WOW as a valid interpretation (though hedges with MOM also being possible)
- Answers 2-5: Explicitly conclude WOW after self-correction

All answers correctly identify:
- M upside down looks like W
- O upside down remains O (has rotational symmetry)

### Areas of Disagreement
The main area of divergence is **how definitively** they state the answer:

**Answer 1** is the outlier - it treats both "MOM" and "WOW" as valid interpretations, calling MOM an "ambigram." This is arguably incorrect reasoning because:
1. True ambigrams read the same when flipped (like SWIMS)
2. MOM does NOT read the same when flipped - it becomes WOW
3. The M->W transformation is a genuine change, not just reorientation

**Answers 2-5** all show a pattern of initially stating "MOM" (perhaps due to the misleading first line) but then self-correcting to WOW. This self-correction pattern is interesting - it suggests the models initially fell for a reasoning trap but recovered.

### Quality Assessment
- **Strongest Answer: Answer 4** - Most direct and concise with clear self-correction
- **Second Strongest: Answers 2, 3, 5** - All show good reasoning with explicit corrections
- **Weakest: Answer 1** - Hedges between interpretations without committing to the correct answer

Note: The first line of ALL answers claims "If you turn the word 'MOM' upside down, you still see 'MOM'" - this appears to be a template or initial response that most answers then correctly override. Answer 1 fails to fully override this initial incorrect claim.

## Final Synthesized Answer

**When you turn the word "MOM" upside down, you see "WOW".**

The reasoning:
1. The letter M, when rotated 180 degrees, visually resembles the letter W
2. The letter O has perfect rotational symmetry - it looks identical when flipped
3. Therefore: M-O-M becomes W-O-W

This is NOT an ambigram (a word that reads the same when flipped). A true ambigram like "SWIMS" reads identically when inverted. "MOM" transforms into a different word - "WOW."

The visual transformation is:
- First M -> W (now in last position due to rotation)
- O -> O (center, unchanged)
- Last M -> W (now in first position due to rotation)
- Result: W-O-W

A child can verify this by writing "MOM" on paper and physically rotating it 180 degrees.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers acknowledge WOW (4/5 explicitly conclude WOW; 1/5 mentions WOW as valid but hedges)
- **Confidence Score: 80%**
- **Reliability Notes**:
  - All answers show initial confusion or hedging, suggesting this question successfully creates some cognitive interference
  - Answer 1's hedging prevents full 100% consensus
  - The self-correction pattern in 4 answers (where they initially say "MOM" then correct to "WOW") is notable
  - The correct answer WOW is well-supported by the reasoning in all answers
  - Minor deduction for Answer 1's failure to definitively choose WOW over the ambigram interpretation
