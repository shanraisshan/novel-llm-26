If you turn the word "MOM" upside down, you still see "MOM".

This is because the letters M, O, and M have rotational symmetry. When you rotate the word 180 degrees:
- The letter M becomes W when flipped upside down, but the word reads backwards
- However, since "MOM" is a palindrome and the letters have the right symmetry, the overall appearance remains "MOM" (or more precisely, it appears as "WOW" if you consider the individual letter transformations)

Actually, to be more precise: when you turn "MOM" upside down (rotate it 180 degrees), you see "WOW". The letter M rotated 180 degrees looks like W, and the letter O remains O (it has rotational symmetry). So MOM becomes WOW.
