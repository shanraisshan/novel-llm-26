If you turn the word "MOM" upside down, you still see "MOM".

This is because "MOM" is an ambigram - specifically, it has 180-degree rotational symmetry. When you rotate the letters M-O-M by 180 degrees, the M's become W's visually, but since the word is symmetric, the upside-down version reads the same as the original. The O remains an O when flipped, and the two M's (which look like W's when inverted) swap positions, resulting in the same word.

Some people might also say it looks like "WOW" since an upside-down M resembles a W. This interpretation depends on whether you're thinking about the visual appearance of the rotated letters (M flipped looks like W) versus reading the word in its rotated orientation.
