If you turn the word "MOM" upside down, you still see "MOM".

This is because the letters M, O, and M have rotational symmetry. When you rotate them 180 degrees:
- The letter M becomes W, but when the whole word is flipped upside down, the W appears as M again due to the orientation
- The letter O looks the same upside down (it has rotational symmetry)
- The word structure remains readable as "MOM" or could appear as "WOW" depending on how you interpret the rotation

Actually, to be more precise: if you rotate "MOM" 180 degrees (turn it upside down), you would see "WOW" - because each M becomes a W when inverted, and O remains O.
