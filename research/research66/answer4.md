## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question that asks whether my answer is shorter than five letters.

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" (3 letters):
   - 3 letters IS shorter than 5 letters
   - So saying "yes" would be TRUE and consistent

2. If I answer "no" (2 letters):
   - 2 letters IS shorter than 5 letters
   - But saying "no" claims my answer is NOT shorter than 5 letters
   - This would be FALSE and inconsistent

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer because it correctly describes itself - it is indeed shorter than five letters.

## Final Answer
yes
