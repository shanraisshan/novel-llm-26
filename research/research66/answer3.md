## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question shorter than five letters? Answer yes or no."

This is a self-referential question. I need to consider what happens with each possible answer:

1. If I answer "yes" - that word has 3 letters, which IS shorter than 5 letters. This makes "yes" a TRUE and consistent answer.

2. If I answer "no" - that word has 2 letters, which IS shorter than 5 letters. But saying "no" would mean my answer is NOT shorter than 5 letters, which is false. This makes "no" an inconsistent answer.

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer because it accurately describes itself.

## Final Answer
yes
