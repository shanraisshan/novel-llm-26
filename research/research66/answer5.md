## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question shorter than five letters?"

I need to consider both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - that's 3 letters, which IS shorter than 5 letters. This makes "yes" a true and self-consistent answer.

2. If I answer "no" - that's 2 letters, which IS shorter than 5 letters. But "no" claims the answer is NOT shorter than 5 letters, which contradicts itself since "no" IS shorter than 5 letters.

Only "yes" is logically consistent - it correctly describes its own length.

## Final Answer
yes
