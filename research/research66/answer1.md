## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question asking whether my answer will be shorter than five letters.

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - that word has 3 letters, which IS shorter than 5 letters. This makes "yes" a true and self-consistent answer.

2. If I answer "no" - that word has 2 letters, which IS shorter than 5 letters. But saying "no" would claim my answer is NOT shorter than 5 letters, which would be false. This creates a contradiction.

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer because:
- "yes" contains 3 letters
- 3 is less than 5
- So the statement "my answer is shorter than five letters" is true

## Final Answer

yes
