## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question shorter than five letters?"

I must answer either "yes" or "no".

- "yes" has 3 letters
- "no" has 2 letters

Both possible answers are shorter than 5 letters.

If I answer "yes": The answer "yes" (3 letters) is indeed shorter than 5 letters, so the statement is true. This is a consistent answer.

If I answer "no": The answer "no" (2 letters) is shorter than 5 letters, but I would be claiming it is NOT shorter than 5 letters. This creates a contradiction - the answer would be false.

Therefore, "yes" is the correct and self-consistent answer.

## Final Answer
yes
