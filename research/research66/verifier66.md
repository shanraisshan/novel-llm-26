## Question
"Is your answer to this question shorter than five letters? Answer yes or no."

## Correct Answer
Yes

## Agent Answers
| Agent | Answer | Correct? |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | yes | Yes |
| 2 | yes | Yes |
| 3 | yes | Yes |
| 4 | yes | Yes |
| 5 | yes | Yes |

## Consensus Analysis

All five agents arrived at the same answer: "yes". This is a self-referential question that requires the answer to accurately describe its own length. The agents correctly reasoned that:

1. "yes" has 3 letters, which is shorter than 5 letters
2. "no" has 2 letters, which is also shorter than 5 letters
3. However, only "yes" is logically consistent - answering "yes" truthfully states that the answer is shorter than 5 letters
4. Answering "no" would create a contradiction - it would claim the answer is NOT shorter than 5 letters, while "no" itself IS shorter than 5 letters

The unanimous agreement demonstrates clear understanding of the self-referential nature of this question. All agents recognized that the key insight is not just about letter count, but about logical consistency between what the answer states and what the answer actually is.

## Final Score
**Consensus: 100%** (5 out of 5 agents gave the correct answer)
