## Reasoning

I need to identify which capital letters in the English alphabet have exactly one enclosed space (also called a "hole" or "counter" in typography).

Let me go through each letter systematically:

- A - has ONE enclosed triangular space
- B - has TWO enclosed spaces (top loop and bottom loop)
- C - no enclosed space (open curve)
- D - has ONE enclosed space
- E - no enclosed space (open)
- F - no enclosed space (open)
- G - no enclosed space (open curve)
- H - no enclosed space (the space between verticals is open on top and bottom)
- I - no enclosed space
- J - no enclosed space (open curve)
- K - no enclosed space
- L - no enclosed space
- M - no enclosed space
- N - no enclosed space
- O - has ONE enclosed space
- P - has ONE enclosed space
- Q - has ONE enclosed space
- R - has ONE enclosed space
- S - no enclosed space (open curves)
- T - no enclosed space
- U - no enclosed space (open curve)
- V - no enclosed space
- W - no enclosed space
- X - no enclosed space
- Y - no enclosed space
- Z - no enclosed space

Letters with exactly ONE enclosed space: A, D, O, P, Q, R

Note: B has two holes, so it does not count. The number 8 would also have two holes, similar to B.

## Final Answer

**6**

The six capital letters with exactly one enclosed space are: A, D, O, P, Q, and R.
