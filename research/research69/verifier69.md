## Question
How many capital letters in the English alphabet have exactly one enclosed space (hole)?

## Correct Answer
6 (The letters A, D, O, P, Q, R)

## Answer Analysis
| Agent | Answer | Correct? |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | 6 (A, D, O, P, Q, R) | Yes |
| 2 | 6 (A, D, O, P, Q, R) | Yes |
| 3 | 6 (A, D, O, P, Q, R) | Yes |
| 4 | 6 (A, D, O, P, Q, R) | Yes |
| 5 | 6 (A, D, O, P, Q, R) | Yes |

## Consensus Score
**100%** (5/5 correct)

## Analysis
All five agents arrived at the identical correct answer, both in terms of the count (6) and the specific letters identified (A, D, O, P, Q, R). This represents perfect consensus.

The reasoning is straightforward from a topological perspective:
- **A** - has one enclosed triangular space at the top
- **D** - has one enclosed space formed by the curve and vertical line
- **O** - has one enclosed circular/oval space
- **P** - has one enclosed space in the upper loop
- **Q** - has one enclosed circular space (the tail extends outside)
- **R** - has one enclosed space in the upper loop

Letters with zero holes include: C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Letters with two holes: B (two enclosed spaces stacked vertically)

The perfect agreement across all agents indicates this is a well-defined problem with a clear, unambiguous answer based on standard typographical representations of capital letters.
