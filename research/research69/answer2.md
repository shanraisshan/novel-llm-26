## Reasoning

I need to identify which capital letters in the English alphabet have exactly one enclosed space (also called a "hole" or "counter" in typography).

Going through each letter of the alphabet:

- A: Has one enclosed triangular space at the top - YES (1 hole)
- B: Has two enclosed spaces (upper and lower loops) - NO (2 holes)
- C: Open curve, no enclosed space - NO
- D: Has one enclosed space - YES (1 hole)
- E: No enclosed space - NO
- F: No enclosed space - NO
- G: No enclosed space (open) - NO
- H: No enclosed space - NO
- I: No enclosed space - NO
- J: No enclosed space - NO
- K: No enclosed space - NO
- L: No enclosed space - NO
- M: No enclosed space - NO
- N: No enclosed space - NO
- O: Has one enclosed space - YES (1 hole)
- P: Has one enclosed space in the loop - YES (1 hole)
- Q: Has one enclosed space - YES (1 hole)
- R: Has one enclosed space in the loop - YES (1 hole)
- S: No enclosed space - NO
- T: No enclosed space - NO
- U: No enclosed space (open at top) - NO
- V: No enclosed space - NO
- W: No enclosed space - NO
- X: No enclosed space - NO
- Y: No enclosed space - NO
- Z: No enclosed space - NO

Letters with exactly one enclosed space: A, D, O, P, Q, R
