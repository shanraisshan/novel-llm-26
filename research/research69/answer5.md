## Reasoning

I need to identify which capital letters in the English alphabet have exactly one enclosed space (also called a "hole" or "counter" in typography).

Let me go through each capital letter A-Z:

- **A**: Has 1 hole (the triangular enclosed space inside)
- **B**: Has 2 holes (upper and lower enclosed spaces) - does NOT qualify
- **C**: No holes (open curve)
- **D**: Has 1 hole (the enclosed space inside)
- **E**: No holes (open shape)
- **F**: No holes (open shape)
- **G**: No holes (open shape)
- **H**: No holes (the space between the verticals is not enclosed)
- **I**: No holes
- **J**: No holes
- **K**: No holes
- **L**: No holes
- **M**: No holes
- **N**: No holes
- **O**: Has 1 hole (the enclosed space inside)
- **P**: Has 1 hole (the enclosed space in the bowl)
- **Q**: Has 1 hole (the enclosed space inside, the tail doesn't create a second hole)
- **R**: Has 1 hole (the enclosed space in the bowl)
- **S**: No holes
- **T**: No holes
- **U**: No holes
- **V**: No holes
- **W**: No holes
- **X**: No holes
- **Y**: No holes
- **Z**: No holes

Letters with exactly ONE enclosed space: **A, D, O, P, Q, R**

Counting these: A, D, O, P, Q, R = 6 letters

## Final Answer

**6**

The six capital letters with exactly one enclosed space (hole) are: A, D, O, P, Q, and R.
