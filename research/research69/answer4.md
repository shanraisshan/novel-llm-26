## Reasoning

I need to identify which capital letters in the English alphabet have exactly one enclosed space (also called a "hole" or "counter" in typography).

Going through each letter A-Z:

- A: Has 1 enclosed triangular space
- B: Has 2 enclosed spaces (top and bottom loops)
- C: No enclosed space (open on the right)
- D: Has 1 enclosed space
- E: No enclosed space (open on the right)
- F: No enclosed space
- G: No enclosed space (open)
- H: No enclosed space (the middle area is not enclosed)
- I: No enclosed space
- J: No enclosed space
- K: No enclosed space
- L: No enclosed space
- M: No enclosed space
- N: No enclosed space
- O: Has 1 enclosed space
- P: Has 1 enclosed space
- Q: Has 1 enclosed space
- R: Has 1 enclosed space
- S: No enclosed space
- T: No enclosed space
- U: No enclosed space (open at top)
- V: No enclosed space
- W: No enclosed space
- X: No enclosed space
- Y: No enclosed space
- Z: No enclosed space

Letters with exactly one enclosed space: A, D, O, P, Q, R

Counting these: 6 letters

## Final Answer

6
