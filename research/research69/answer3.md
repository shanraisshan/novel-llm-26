## Reasoning

I need to identify which capital letters in the English alphabet have exactly one enclosed space (also called a "hole" or "counter" in typography).

Let me go through each letter:

- A - has one enclosed triangular space (1 hole)
- B - has two enclosed spaces (2 holes)
- C - no enclosed space, it's open (0 holes)
- D - has one enclosed space (1 hole)
- E - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- F - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- G - no enclosed space, it's open (0 holes)
- H - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- I - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- J - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- K - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- L - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- M - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- N - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- O - has one enclosed space (1 hole)
- P - has one enclosed space (1 hole)
- Q - has one enclosed space (1 hole)
- R - has one enclosed space (1 hole)
- S - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- T - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- U - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- V - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- W - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- X - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- Y - no enclosed space (0 holes)
- Z - no enclosed space (0 holes)

Letters with exactly one enclosed space: A, D, O, P, Q, R

Counting these: A, D, O, P, Q, R = 6 letters

## Final Answer

6
