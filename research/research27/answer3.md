# Answer 3

## Reasoning

This is a classic self-referential paradox, similar to the liar's paradox. Let me analyze both possible answers:

**If I answer "Yes":**
- I am claiming I will answer correctly
- If "Yes" is indeed the correct answer, then I answered correctly, making "Yes" true
- But what makes "Yes" correct? Only that I said it and it matched reality
- This creates a consistent loop: Yes is correct because I said Yes and was correct

**If I answer "No":**
- I am claiming I will NOT answer correctly
- If "No" is the correct answer, then I answered correctly, which contradicts my claim of "No"
- If "No" is incorrect, then I did answer correctly, but then "No" would be wrong about that
- This creates a paradox: if No is correct, then I answered correctly, making No false

The key insight is that "Yes" is self-consistent while "No" is self-contradictory. If I say "Yes" and commit to that being my answer, then the statement validates itself - I answered, and if we accept my answer as correct, then "Yes" was accurate.

However, there is a deeper issue: what determines correctness here? There is no external fact being referenced - the question only refers to itself. In such cases, "Yes" works as a stable fixed point while "No" does not.

## Final Answer

Yes
