# Answer 2

## Reasoning
This is a classic self-referential paradox, similar to the liar's paradox.

Let me analyze both possible answers:

**If I answer "Yes":**
- I am claiming I will answer correctly
- For this to be true, "Yes" must be the correct answer
- But what makes "Yes" correct? Only if I actually do answer correctly
- This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy - if "Yes" is correct, then saying "Yes" is correct

**If I answer "No":**
- I am claiming I will NOT answer correctly
- If "No" is the correct answer, then by saying "No" I have answered correctly
- But if I answered correctly, then "No" (claiming I would not answer correctly) is false
- This creates a contradiction - a paradox

The paradox structure:
- "No" leads to contradiction: If No is correct, I answered correctly, making No false
- "Yes" is self-consistent: If Yes is correct, I answered correctly, making Yes true

From a logical standpoint, "Yes" is the only answer that can be consistently true. "No" is necessarily self-contradictory. While "Yes" requires a kind of self-validation, it does not produce a logical contradiction.

## Final Answer
Yes
