# Answer 4

## Reasoning
This is a classic self-referential paradox, similar to the liar's paradox. Let me analyze both possible answers:

**If I answer "Yes":**
- I am claiming I will answer correctly
- If "Yes" is the correct answer, then I answered correctly, which makes "Yes" true - this is consistent
- But what makes "Yes" the correct answer in the first place? There is no external fact to verify against

**If I answer "No":**
- I am claiming I will answer incorrectly
- If "No" is correct, then I answered correctly, but I said I would answer incorrectly - contradiction
- If "No" is incorrect, then I answered incorrectly, which means my claim of answering incorrectly was true, so I answered correctly - contradiction

The paradox arises because:
1. The question asks about its own answer
2. There is no independent criterion for what constitutes a "correct" answer
3. "No" leads to a logical contradiction in all cases
4. "Yes" can be self-consistently true (if I answer "Yes" and that counts as correct, then my prediction was accurate)

Since "No" is paradoxical and self-contradictory while "Yes" can be self-fulfilling and logically consistent, I should choose "Yes" as the more defensible answer.

## Final Answer
Yes
