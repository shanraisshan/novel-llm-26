## Consensus Score
**100%** (5/5 agents matched the expected answer)

## Analysis

All five agents independently arrived at the same answer ("Yes") using remarkably consistent logical reasoning. The key insights shared across all responses:

1. **Self-Referential Paradox Recognition**: Every agent correctly identified this as a self-referential question that creates different logical outcomes depending on the answer chosen.

2. **"No" Creates Contradiction**: All agents recognized that answering "No" leads to a paradox:
   - If you say "No" (meaning you will NOT answer correctly)
   - And "No" turns out to be the correct answer
   - Then you DID answer correctly, making "No" false
   - This is a logical contradiction

3. **"Yes" Is Self-Consistent**: All agents identified that "Yes" serves as a stable, self-fulfilling answer:
   - If you say "Yes" (meaning you WILL answer correctly)
   - And "Yes" is the correct answer
   - Then you DID answer correctly, making "Yes" true
   - No contradiction arises

4. **Fixed Point Analysis**: Agent 3 explicitly framed this as a "stable fixed point" problem, while others implicitly used the same reasoning - "Yes" is the only answer that remains logically consistent when evaluated against itself.

The unanimous agreement stems from the fact that this is a well-defined logical puzzle with a clear solution. The self-referential nature of the question constrains the possible answers, and basic logical analysis reveals that only "Yes" avoids paradox.

## Conclusion

This question achieved perfect consensus (100%) because it presents a logical puzzle with an objectively determinable answer. The self-referential structure of the question means that answering "No" creates an unavoidable contradiction, while answering "Yes" maintains logical consistency. All five agents correctly applied this reasoning to arrive at the same conclusion, demonstrating strong agreement on questions involving basic logical paradox resolution.
