# Answer 1

## Reasoning

This is a classic self-referential paradox, similar to the liar's paradox. Let me analyze both possible answers:

**If I answer "Yes":**
- I am claiming I will answer correctly
- But whether this is correct depends on whether my answer matches reality
- If "Yes" is the correct answer, then I answered correctly, making "Yes" true
- This seems consistent - no contradiction here

**If I answer "No":**
- I am claiming I will NOT answer correctly
- If "No" is the correct answer, then I answered correctly
- But if I answered correctly, then my claim of "No" (that I won't answer correctly) is false
- This creates a contradiction - a paradox

The key insight is that "Yes" is self-consistent while "No" is self-contradictory. If I say "Yes" and that turns out to be correct, no paradox arises. The answer "Yes" can be true without contradiction.

However, there is a deeper issue: at the moment of answering, I cannot know with certainty whether my answer is correct because the correctness of my answer depends on whether it matches reality, and the reality in question is precisely whether my answer is correct. This creates a strange loop.

Despite this philosophical complexity, from a practical standpoint, "Yes" is the only answer that can possibly be correct without creating a logical contradiction. Answering "No" guarantees a paradox, while answering "Yes" at least allows for the possibility of being correct.

## Final Answer

Yes
