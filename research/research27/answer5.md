# Answer 5

## Reasoning

This is a classic self-referential paradox, similar to the liar's paradox. Let me analyze both possible answers:

**If I answer "Yes":**
- I am claiming I will answer correctly
- But whether this is correct depends on whether my answer matches reality
- If "Yes" is the correct answer, then I answered correctly, making "Yes" true
- This seems consistent... but is it?

**If I answer "No":**
- I am claiming I will answer incorrectly
- If "No" is correct, then I answered correctly, which contradicts my claim of answering incorrectly
- If "No" is incorrect, then I answered incorrectly, which means my claim was actually true, making "No" correct
- This creates a contradiction

The paradox arises because the question's correctness is defined by the answer itself. There is no external fact to verify against - the answer determines its own truth value.

However, I must give an answer. "Yes" at least has a self-consistent interpretation: if I say "Yes" and that constitutes answering correctly, then the statement is true. "No" leads to unavoidable contradiction.

Some might argue neither answer is truly correct because the question is ill-formed. But pragmatically, "Yes" is the more defensible choice since it can be self-consistently true, while "No" cannot be.

## Final Answer

Yes
