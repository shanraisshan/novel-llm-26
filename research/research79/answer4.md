## Reasoning

I need to count how many times the digit sequence '11' appears in the number 11111.

The number 11111 has 5 digits: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

To find overlapping occurrences of '11', I check each consecutive pair of digits:
- Positions 1-2: "11" - match
- Positions 2-3: "11" - match
- Positions 3-4: "11" - match
- Positions 4-5: "11" - match

Since the number has 5 digits, there are 4 possible consecutive pairs to check, and all 4 of them form the sequence '11'.

## Final Answer

4
