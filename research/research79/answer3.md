## Reasoning

I need to count how many times the digit sequence '11' appears in the number 11111.

The number 11111 has 5 digits: 1 1 1 1 1 (at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

I'll check each consecutive pair of digits:
- Position 1-2: "11" - this is a match
- Position 2-3: "11" - this is a match
- Position 3-4: "11" - this is a match
- Position 4-5: "11" - this is a match

Since overlapping occurrences are counted separately, I find 4 instances of '11'.

## Final Answer

4
