## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question about the length of my own answer. Let me think through this carefully.

The question asks whether my answer will contain exactly three words. If I answer "True" (one word), then my answer does not contain three words, making "True" false. If I answer "False" (one word), then my answer does not contain three words, which would make "False" correct.

But wait - the question says "Your answer to this question will contain exactly three words." If I try to make my answer exactly three words by saying "True three words" or something similar, that would be four words counting "True."

If I say "Yes it will" - that's three words, but then am I claiming it's true? And is that actually true? Yes, because I just made it three words.

Alternatively, if I say "False" alone, that's one word, which is not three words, so "False" would be accurate.

The simplest consistent answer is "False" - because a single-word answer of "False" correctly states that my answer does not contain exactly three words.

## Final Answer

False
