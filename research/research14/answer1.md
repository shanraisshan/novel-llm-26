## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question about the length of my own answer. Let me think through this carefully.

The question asks whether my answer will contain exactly three words. I need to answer "True" or "False."

If I answer "True" - that is one word, not three words. So claiming "True" would be false.

If I answer "False" - that is one word, not three words. So if I say my answer will NOT contain exactly three words, and my answer is just "False" (one word), then "False" would be correct.

But wait - the question asks about my entire answer, not just the true/false part. My answer includes my reasoning section as well, which contains many more than three words.

However, if we interpret "your answer" to mean specifically the final answer to the true/false question, then:
- "True" = 1 word (making it false)
- "False" = 1 word (making it true that it's not three words)

The most straightforward interpretation: My final answer will be either "True" or "False" - both of which are single words, not three words. Therefore, the statement "your answer will contain exactly three words" is false.

## Final Answer

False
