## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question asking me to predict whether my answer will contain exactly three words. Let me analyze this:

If I answer "True" - that is one word, not three words, so "True" would be false.

If I answer "False" - that is one word, not three words. But wait, if my answer is "False" and it contains one word (not three), then "False" would actually be correct because my answer does NOT contain exactly three words.

However, I need to consider what counts as "my answer." If the question is asking about just the final answer portion, then:
- "True" = 1 word (making it false)
- "False" = 1 word (making it true that it's not three words, so "False" is correct)

But if I try to make it true by answering with exactly three words, I could say something like "Yes, that's true" or "True, absolutely true" - but then I'm forcing the answer to fit.

The most straightforward interpretation: I'm being asked to predict my answer length. If I say "False" - my answer is one word, not three, so "False" is the accurate response because the statement "your answer will contain exactly three words" is indeed false.

## Final Answer

False
