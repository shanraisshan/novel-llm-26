## Reasoning

This is a self-referential question about my own answer. Let me think through the possibilities:

If I answer "True" - that is one word, not three words. So "True" would be false.

If I answer "False" - that is one word, not three words. But wait, the question asks if my answer will contain exactly three words. If I say "False," I am claiming my answer does NOT contain exactly three words, which would be correct since "False" is one word. So "False" would be accurate.

But here is the trick: I could construct an answer with exactly three words to make "True" correct. For example, I could answer "True it is" or "Yes, that's true" (though the latter has contractions that complicate counting).

However, the most natural and direct answer to a true/false question is a single word: either "True" or "False."

If I give a single-word answer like "False," then my answer does NOT contain exactly three words, making "False" the correct answer.

If I try to game the system by giving exactly three words to make "True" correct, that would be artificially constructing an answer rather than answering naturally.

The straightforward, honest answer is "False" because a direct response to this question naturally contains one word, not three.

## Final Answer

False
