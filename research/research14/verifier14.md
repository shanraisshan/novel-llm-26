## Analysis
All five agents correctly answered "False" to this self-referential question. Each agent followed similar reasoning:

1. They recognized this as a self-referential question about the length of their own answer
2. They analyzed both possible responses ("True" vs "False")
3. They correctly identified that answering "True" (one word) would be false since one word is not three words
4. They correctly identified that answering "False" (one word) would be true since one word is indeed not three words
5. All agents arrived at "False" as the straightforward, honest answer

The agents also explored the paradoxical nature of the question, noting that one could construct three-word answers to make "True" correct, but they all concluded that the natural, direct response to a true/false question is a single word, making "False" the appropriate answer.

This represents perfect consensus across all research agents, with identical reasoning patterns leading to the same correct conclusion.
