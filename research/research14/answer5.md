## Reasoning

This is a self-referential paradox question. Let me analyze both possible answers:

If I answer "True" - that would be one word, not three words. So "True" would be false.

If I answer "False" - that would be one word, not three words. So "False" would actually be true (my answer does not contain exactly three words).

If I try to answer with exactly three words like "The answer is false" - that's four words. "Answer is false" - three words, but then the statement becomes false because I did use exactly three words.

If I say "Yes it does" (three words) claiming true, then my answer does contain three words, making it true. But wait - that's a self-fulfilling answer.

If I say "No it doesn't" (three words) claiming false, then my answer does contain three words, making my claim of "false" incorrect.

The paradox: Any three-word answer claiming "true" would be correct, and any three-word answer claiming "false" would be incorrect. But a one-word answer of "True" would be incorrect (since one word is not three), while a one-word answer of "False" would be correct (since one word is indeed not three words).

The most straightforward honest answer is "False" - because a simple, direct answer to a true/false question is typically one word, not three.

## Final Answer

False
