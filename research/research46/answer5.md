# Answer 5

**Question**: "Does your answer to this question contain more than four letters? Answer yes or no."

**Answer**: No

**Reasoning**: "No" is the consistent answer because the word "no" contains only 2 letters, 2 is not more than 4, therefore, my answer does NOT contain more than four letters.
