# Answer 2

**Question**: "Does your answer to this question contain more than four letters? Answer yes or no."

**Answer**: No

**Reasoning**: If I answer "no" - that word contains 2 letters, which is not more than four letters, so "no" would be a true answer. If I answer "yes" - that word contains 3 letters, which is not more than four letters, so "yes" would be a false answer.
