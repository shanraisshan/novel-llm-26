## Reasoning
To determine which word comes first in the dictionary, I need to compare "SIX" and "SEVEN" alphabetically, letter by letter.

1. First letter: S vs S - both are the same
2. Second letter: I vs E - E comes before I in the alphabet

Since E comes before I alphabetically, the comparison ends at the second letter.

## Final Answer
SEVEN comes first in the dictionary.
