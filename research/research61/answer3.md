## Reasoning
To determine which word comes first in the dictionary, I need to compare "SIX" and "SEVEN" alphabetically, letter by letter:

1. Both words start with "S" - so we move to the next letter
2. The second letter of "SEVEN" is "E"
3. The second letter of "SIX" is "I"
4. In the alphabet, "E" comes before "I"

Since "E" comes before "I" in alphabetical order, "SEVEN" comes before "SIX" in the dictionary.

## Final Answer
SEVEN
