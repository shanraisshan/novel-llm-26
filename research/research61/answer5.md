## Reasoning

To determine which word comes first in the dictionary, I need to compare "SIX" and "SEVEN" alphabetically, letter by letter.

1. First letter: Both words start with "S" - they are equal
2. Second letter: "I" (from SIX) vs "E" (from SEVEN)
   - In the alphabet, E comes before I
   - E is the 5th letter, I is the 9th letter

Since "E" comes before "I" in the alphabet, "SEVEN" comes before "SIX" in dictionary order.

## Final Answer

SEVEN
