## Reasoning
To determine which word comes first in the dictionary, I need to compare the words alphabetically:

1. Both words start with "S"
2. Comparing the second letter: SIX has "I" and SEVEN has "E"
3. In the alphabet, "E" comes before "I"
4. Therefore, SEVEN (with "E" as the second letter) comes before SIX (with "I" as the second letter)

## Final Answer
SEVEN comes first in the dictionary.
