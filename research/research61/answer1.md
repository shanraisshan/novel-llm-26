## Reasoning
To determine which word comes first in the dictionary, I need to compare the words alphabetically letter by letter.

1. Both words start with "S" - same first letter
2. Compare the second letter: "SEVEN" has "E" and "SIX" has "I"
3. In the alphabet, "E" comes before "I" (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I...)
4. Since "E" comes before "I", "SEVEN" comes before "SIX" alphabetically

## Final Answer
SEVEN comes first in the dictionary.
