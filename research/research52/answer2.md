## Reasoning
To determine which word comes first alphabetically when sorting by the LAST letter, I need to:

1. Identify the last letter of each word:
   - CAT ends with "T"
   - DOG ends with "G"

2. Compare these last letters alphabetically:
   - G is the 7th letter of the alphabet
   - T is the 20th letter of the alphabet
   - Therefore, G comes before T alphabetically

3. Since we are sorting by the last letter, the word whose last letter comes first alphabetically will be listed first.

## Final Answer
DOG comes first alphabetically when sorting by the last letter, because G (the last letter of DOG) comes before T (the last letter of CAT) in the alphabet.
