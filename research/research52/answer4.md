## Reasoning
To solve this, I need to:
1. Identify the last letter of each word
2. Compare those letters alphabetically

- CAT ends with the letter "T"
- DOG ends with the letter "G"

Now I compare G and T alphabetically:
- G is the 7th letter of the alphabet
- T is the 20th letter of the alphabet
- G comes before T

Therefore, when sorting by the last letter alphabetically, DOG (ending in G) comes before CAT (ending in T).

## Final Answer
DOG
