## Reasoning
To determine which word comes first alphabetically when sorting by the LAST letter, I need to:

1. Identify the last letter of each word:
   - CAT ends with "T"
   - DOG ends with "G"

2. Compare these letters alphabetically:
   - G comes before T in the alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F, G... T)

3. Therefore, the word ending with "G" comes first when sorting by last letter.

## Final Answer
DOG comes first alphabetically when sorting by the last letter, because G (the last letter of DOG) comes before T (the last letter of CAT) in the alphabet.
