## Reasoning
1. Identify the last letter of each word:
   - CAT: last letter is T
   - DOG: last letter is G

2. Compare these letters alphabetically:
   - G comes before T in the alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F, G... T)

3. Therefore, when sorting by the last letter alphabetically, DOG (ending in G) comes before CAT (ending in T).

## Final Answer
DOG
