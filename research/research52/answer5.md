## Reasoning
To determine which word comes first alphabetically when sorting by the LAST letter, I need to:

1. Identify the last letter of each word:
   - CAT ends with T
   - DOG ends with G

2. Compare these last letters alphabetically:
   - G comes before T in the alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, ... T)

3. Therefore, when sorting by the last letter, DOG (ending in G) comes before CAT (ending in T).

## Final Answer
DOG
