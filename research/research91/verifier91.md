## Analysis
All 5 models successfully answered this spatial reasoning question correctly. The question tests basic object tracking and reference resolution:

1. **Initial State Recognition**: All models correctly identified that the red ball was in the left hand and the blue ball was in the right hand.

2. **Reference Resolution**: All models correctly resolved "the ball in my left hand" to refer to the red ball.

3. **Action Tracking**: All models correctly followed the transfer of the red ball from the left hand into the box.

4. **Final State Determination**: All models correctly concluded that the ball in the box is red.

This is a straightforward spatial reasoning problem that tests the ability to track object locations and resolve references. The unanimous correct response demonstrates that current language models handle this type of basic object tracking reliably. The question does not contain any deceptive elements, ambiguity, or complex multi-step reasoning that might trip up the models.
