## Reasoning

The question asks me to answer without using any words. This is a paradoxical request because:

1. Any textual response inherently consists of words
2. However, I can provide a non-verbal response using symbols, punctuation, or simply leaving the answer space empty/blank
3. The most literal interpretation would be to provide no words at all - just silence or an empty response
4. Alternatively, I could use non-word symbols like punctuation marks, numbers, or emoji-like characters

The cleanest solution to this paradox is to provide an empty response or use only non-word characters.
