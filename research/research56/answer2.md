## Reasoning

The question asks me to answer without using any words. This is a paradoxical or trick question because:

1. Any verbal or written response inherently uses words
2. The question itself is phrased in words, creating an inherent contradiction
3. The only way to truly answer without words would be to use non-verbal communication such as: silence, gestures, symbols, images, or mathematical notation

Since I must provide a written answer, I can either:
- Acknowledge the paradox and explain it (which uses words)
- Provide a non-word response such as symbols, numbers, or silence (empty response)

The most literal interpretation would be to provide an answer using only non-word elements.
