## Reasoning

The question asks me to "answer this question without using any words." This is a paradoxical request because:

1. Any verbal or written response inherently uses words
2. The question itself is phrased in words, creating an ironic contradiction
3. To truly answer without words, I would need to use non-verbal communication such as symbols, gestures, images, or simply silence

Possible approaches:
- Use only symbols or punctuation (no words)
- Use only numbers
- Use an image or emoji
- Provide an empty response (silence)
- Use a mathematical expression

The most literal interpretation would be to provide a response that contains no words at all - just symbols, numbers, or nothing.
