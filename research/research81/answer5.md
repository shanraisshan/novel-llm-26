## Reasoning
The question asks which word comes second in the list 'second, fourth, first, third'.

Let me identify each word by its position in the list:
- Position 1: "second"
- Position 2: "fourth"
- Position 3: "first"
- Position 4: "third"

The question is asking about the positional order of the words in the list, not about the meaning of the words themselves. The word in the second position is "fourth".

## Final Answer
fourth
