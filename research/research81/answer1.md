## Reasoning
The question asks which word comes second in the list 'second, fourth, first, third'.

Let me identify the position of each word in this list:
1. First position: "second"
2. Second position: "fourth"
3. Third position: "first"
4. Fourth position: "third"

The question asks which word comes second (i.e., which word is in the second position of the list).

## Final Answer
fourth
