## Reasoning
The question asks which word comes second in the list 'second, fourth, first, third'.

I need to identify the word at position 2 in this list (not the word "second", but the word that occupies the second position).

Breaking down the list by position:
- Position 1: "second"
- Position 2: "fourth"
- Position 3: "first"
- Position 4: "third"

The word in the second position is "fourth".

## Final Answer
fourth
