## Reasoning
Let me count the letter 'a' in 'abracadabra' by going through each position:

The word spelled out: a-b-r-a-c-a-d-a-b-r-a

1. **a** - this is an 'a'
2. b - not an 'a'
3. r - not an 'a'
4. **a** - this is an 'a'
5. c - not an 'a'
6. **a** - this is an 'a'
7. d - not an 'a'
8. **a** - this is an 'a'
9. b - not an 'a'
10. r - not an 'a'
11. **a** - this is an 'a'

Counting the occurrences: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

## Final Answer
5
