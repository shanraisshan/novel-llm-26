## Reasoning

Let me analyze each word and its pronunciation:

1. **"one"** - This is pronounced /wʌn/ (sounds like "wun")
2. **"won"** - This is pronounced /wʌn/ (sounds like "wun")
3. **"sun"** - This is pronounced /sʌn/ (sounds like "sun")

Now let me compare them:
- "one" and "won" are homophones - they sound exactly the same when spoken aloud
- "sun" has a different initial consonant sound (s vs w) than "one"/"won"

So when saying these three words out loud:
- "one" = /wʌn/
- "won" = /wʌn/ (same as "one")
- "sun" = /sʌn/ (different sound)

## Final Answer

2

You make two different sounds. "One" and "won" are homophones (they sound identical), while "sun" has a distinct sound.
