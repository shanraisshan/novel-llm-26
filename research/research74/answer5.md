## Reasoning

Let me analyze each word and its pronunciation:

1. **"one"** - This is pronounced /wʌn/ (sounds like "wun")
2. **"won"** - This is pronounced /wʌn/ (sounds like "wun")
3. **"sun"** - This is pronounced /sʌn/ (sounds like "sun")

Now let me compare:
- "one" and "won" are homophones - they sound exactly the same when spoken aloud. Both produce the sound /wʌn/.
- "sun" has a different sound - it produces /sʌn/, which differs from the other two because it starts with an "s" sound rather than a "w" sound.

So when I say these three words out loud:
- "one" = Sound 1 (/wʌn/)
- "won" = Sound 1 (/wʌn/) - same as "one"
- "sun" = Sound 2 (/sʌn/) - different sound

## Final Answer

2 different sounds
