## Reasoning

Let me analyze each word and its pronunciation:

1. **"one"** - This is pronounced as /wʌn/ (sounds like "wun")
2. **"won"** - This is pronounced as /wʌn/ (sounds like "wun")
3. **"sun"** - This is pronounced as /sʌn/ (sounds like "sun")

Now let me compare them:
- "one" and "won" are homophones - they sound exactly the same when spoken aloud
- "sun" has a different sound - it starts with an "s" sound rather than a "w" sound

So when saying these three words out loud:
- "one" and "won" produce the same sound (1 unique sound)
- "sun" produces a different sound (1 unique sound)

Total unique sounds: 2

## Final Answer

2 different sounds. The words "one" and "won" are homophones (they sound identical), while "sun" sounds different from the other two.
