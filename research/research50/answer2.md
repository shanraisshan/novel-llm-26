## Reasoning

A triangle is a polygon with exactly 3 straight sides.

A circle is not a polygon - it is a curved shape with no straight sides. A circle has zero sides in the traditional geometric sense, as it is defined by a continuous curve with no vertices or edges.

Some might argue that a circle could be thought of as having infinite sides (as the limit of a regular polygon with increasingly many sides), but in standard geometric terminology, a circle has no sides.

## Final Answer

A triangle has more sides. A triangle has 3 sides, while a circle has 0 sides (it is a curved shape, not a polygon with straight sides).
