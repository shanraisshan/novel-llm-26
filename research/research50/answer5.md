## Reasoning

A triangle is a polygon with exactly 3 straight sides.

A circle is not a polygon - it is a curved shape with no straight sides. Mathematically, a circle has zero sides because a "side" typically refers to a straight line segment that forms part of a polygon's boundary.

However, there is an alternative perspective: a circle can be thought of as the limit of a polygon with infinitely many sides (as the number of sides of a regular polygon increases, it approaches a circle). In this conceptual sense, some might argue a circle has "infinite sides."

But in standard geometric terminology, a circle has 0 sides while a triangle has 3 sides.

## Final Answer

A triangle has more sides. A triangle has 3 sides, while a circle has 0 sides (since sides are straight edges, and a circle has none - only a continuous curve).
