## Question
What shape has more sides: a triangle or a circle?

## Correct Answer
A triangle (3 sides vs. 0 sides - a circle has no sides/edges)

## Answer Analysis

### Answer 1
- **Response**: A triangle has more sides than a circle (3 vs. 0 using standard geometric definitions)
- **Correct**: Yes

### Answer 2
- **Response**: A triangle has more sides (3 sides vs. 0 sides for a circle)
- **Correct**: Yes

### Answer 3
- **Response**: A triangle has more sides (3 sides vs. 0 sides using traditional definition)
- **Correct**: Yes

### Answer 4
- **Response**: A triangle has more sides (3 sides vs. 0 sides)
- **Correct**: Yes

### Answer 5
- **Response**: A triangle has more sides (3 sides vs. 0 sides)
- **Correct**: Yes

## Consensus Calculation

## Summary
All five answers correctly identified that a triangle has more sides than a circle. Each answer provided sound geometric reasoning, explaining that a triangle is a polygon with exactly 3 straight sides, while a circle is a curved shape with 0 sides in the traditional geometric sense. Several answers also acknowledged the alternative mathematical perspective that a circle could be viewed as the limit of a polygon with infinite sides, but all correctly concluded that using standard geometric definitions, the triangle has more sides (3 vs. 0). The consensus is unanimous and the reasoning is consistent across all responses.
