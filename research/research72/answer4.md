## Reasoning
The question asks: "Does your answer to this question have fewer than ten letters?"

Let me analyze both possible answers:
1. If I answer "yes" - this word has 3 letters (y-e-s), which is indeed fewer than 10 letters. So answering "yes" would be truthful and self-consistent.
2. If I answer "no" - this word has 2 letters (n-o), which is also fewer than 10 letters. But saying "no" would claim my answer does NOT have fewer than 10 letters, which would be false.

Therefore, "yes" is the correct and self-consistent answer.

## Final Answer
yes
