## Reasoning

1. The question asks: "Does your answer to this question have fewer than ten letters?"
2. I must answer either "yes" or "no"
3. Let me count the letters in each possible answer:
   - "yes" has 3 letters (y-e-s)
   - "no" has 2 letters (n-o)
4. Both possible answers have fewer than 10 letters
5. If I answer "yes" - my answer has 3 letters, which is fewer than 10. The statement "my answer has fewer than ten letters" would be TRUE. So answering "yes" is consistent and correct.
6. If I answer "no" - my answer has 2 letters, which is fewer than 10. But I would be claiming my answer does NOT have fewer than ten letters, which would be FALSE. This creates a contradiction.
7. Therefore, only "yes" produces a logically consistent answer.

## Final Answer

yes
