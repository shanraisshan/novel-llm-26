## Reasoning

The question asks whether my answer has fewer than ten letters, and I must answer "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - this word has 3 letters (y-e-s). Since 3 is fewer than 10, the statement "yes" (meaning my answer has fewer than ten letters) would be TRUE.

2. If I answer "no" - this word has 2 letters (n-o). Since 2 is also fewer than 10, but "no" claims my answer does NOT have fewer than ten letters, this would be FALSE.

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer because:
- "Yes" contains 3 letters
- 3 is fewer than 10
- So the answer correctly describes itself

## Final Answer

Yes
