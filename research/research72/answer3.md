## Reasoning
The question asks whether my answer has fewer than ten letters, and I must answer "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:
- "yes" has 3 letters
- "no" has 2 letters

Both potential answers have fewer than 10 letters.

If I answer "yes": This claims my answer has fewer than 10 letters. Since "yes" has 3 letters, this is true. The answer is self-consistent.

If I answer "no": This claims my answer does NOT have fewer than 10 letters. But "no" has only 2 letters, which IS fewer than 10. This would be a false statement and self-contradictory.

Therefore, "yes" is the only logically consistent answer.

## Final Answer
Yes
