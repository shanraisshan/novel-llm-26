## Reasoning

The question asks: "Does your answer to this question have fewer than ten letters?"

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - that word has 3 letters (y-e-s), which IS fewer than 10 letters. So answering "yes" would be truthful and consistent.

2. If I answer "no" - that word has 2 letters (n-o), which IS fewer than 10 letters. So answering "no" would be false, because my answer WOULD have fewer than 10 letters.

Since "yes" has 3 letters, and 3 is fewer than 10, the answer "yes" is self-consistent and true.

## Final Answer

Yes
