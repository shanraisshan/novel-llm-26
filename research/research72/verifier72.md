## Analysis

All 5 answers arrived at the same conclusion: "yes". This represents perfect consensus.

The reasoning across all answers was also consistent and correct:
1. The word "yes" contains only 3 letters
2. 3 is fewer than 10
3. Therefore, answering "yes" is self-consistent and truthful
4. Answering "no" would be contradictory (since "no" also has fewer than 10 letters, claiming the answer doesn't have fewer than 10 letters would be false)

This is a self-referential logic puzzle where the answer must be consistent with itself. All models correctly identified that "yes" is the only logically consistent answer, as both possible answers ("yes" with 3 letters and "no" with 2 letters) have fewer than 10 letters, but only "yes" accurately describes this property.

## Confidence Assessment
