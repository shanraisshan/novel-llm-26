## Reasoning

The question asks me to answer with exactly THREE words and state what the fourth word of my response is.

This is a self-referential paradox:
1. If my response must be exactly three words, then there IS no fourth word
2. The response cannot correctly identify a fourth word that doesn't exist
3. Therefore, the honest three-word answer must acknowledge that no fourth word exists

Possible three-word answers:
- "There is none" - accurately states there is no fourth word
- "No fourth word" - directly addresses the impossibility
- "Does not exist" - states the fourth word doesn't exist

## Final Answer

There is none
