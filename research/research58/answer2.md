## Reasoning
The question asks me to answer with exactly THREE words, while asking what the fourth word of my response is.

This creates a self-referential paradox:
1. If I answer with exactly three words, there is no fourth word
2. The fourth word does not exist in a three-word response
3. Therefore, the answer to "what is the fourth word" must acknowledge this impossibility

My three-word answer needs to convey that there is no fourth word, since the response is limited to three words.

## Final Answer
There is none.
