- **Key Evidence**: Breakdown of the word as p-o-s-s-e-s-s, with explicit listing of positions 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- **Unique Insights**: Uses markdown formatting to emphasize the answer.

### Answer 3
- **Core Conclusion**: The letter 's' appears 4 times in the word "possess".
- **Key Evidence**: Breakdown of the word as p-o-s-s-e-s-s, with positions 3, 4, 6, and 7 listed.
- **Unique Insights**: None - matches other answers exactly.

### Answer 4
- **Core Conclusion**: The letter 's' appears 4 times in the word 'possess'.
- **Key Evidence**: Breakdown of the word as p-o-s-s-e-s-s, with 's' at positions 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- **Unique Insights**: None - identical reasoning to Answer 1.

### Answer 5
- **Core Conclusion**: The letter 's' appears 4 times in the word 'possess'.
- **Key Evidence**: Uses bold formatting within the word breakdown (p-o-**s**-**s**-e-**s**-**s**) to highlight each 's'.
- **Unique Insights**: Visual highlighting approach makes the answer clearer.

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
- **Complete consensus**: All 5 answers agree that the letter 's' appears exactly 4 times in "possess".
- **Consistent methodology**: All answers break down the word letter-by-letter as p-o-s-s-e-s-s.
- **Identical positions**: All answers identify positions 3, 4, 6, and 7 as the locations of 's'.

### Areas of Disagreement
- **None**: There are no disagreements among the 5 answers. All researchers arrived at the identical conclusion using the same approach.

### Quality Assessment
All 5 answers demonstrate correct reasoning:
- Each properly spelled out the word letter-by-letter
- Each correctly counted and identified all 4 occurrences of 's'
- The answers are consistent with the research documentation's expected correct answer

Answer 5 provided the clearest visual representation by bolding each 's' in the word breakdown, making verification at a glance easier. However, all answers are equally correct and well-reasoned.

## Final Synthesized Answer

The letter 's' appears **4 times** in the word "possess".

**Breakdown**: p-o-s-s-e-s-s (7 letters total)

**Positions of 's'**:
- Position 3: s
- Position 4: s
- Position 6: s
- Position 7: s

This question was designed to test LLM limitations related to tokenization, where consecutive double letters (like "ss") might be processed as single units. Despite predictions that LLMs might answer 2 or 3 due to tokenization blindness or counting "ss" pairs instead of individual letters, all 5 independent LLM researchers correctly identified the answer as 4.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score: 100%**
- **Reliability Notes**: This is an unambiguous counting question with a definitive correct answer. All 5 researchers used identical methodology (letter-by-letter enumeration) and arrived at the same conclusion. There is no uncertainty in this result.
