## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is the number of words in your answer to this question less than three?"

Let me analyze this:
1. I must answer either "yes" or "no"
2. If I answer "yes" - that is 1 word, which IS less than 3, making the answer truthful and consistent
3. If I answer "no" - that is 1 word, which IS less than 3, but the answer claims it is NOT less than 3, making it false and inconsistent

Therefore, "yes" is the correct answer because:
- "yes" contains 1 word
- 1 is less than 3
- So the statement "the number of words in my answer is less than three" is TRUE

## Final Answer

yes
