## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question. I need to determine if my answer will have fewer than three words.

- If I answer "yes" - that is 1 word, which is indeed less than 3, so "yes" would be a true and consistent answer.
- If I answer "no" - that is 1 word, which is less than 3, so saying "no" (claiming my answer has 3 or more words) would be false.

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer because a one-word answer of "yes" correctly describes itself as having fewer than three words.

## Final Answer
Yes
