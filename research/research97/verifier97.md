### Consensus Analysis
All 5 answerers arrived at the same conclusion: "Yes" (or "yes"). Each answerer correctly recognized that this is a self-referential question and applied the same logical reasoning:

1. If you answer "yes" - that is 1 word, which is less than 3, making the answer truthful and self-consistent.
2. If you answer "no" - that is 1 word, which is less than 3, but "no" would claim the answer has 3 or more words, making it false and self-contradictory.

Therefore, "yes" is the only logically consistent answer. All 5 answerers demonstrated sound reasoning and arrived at the correct answer independently.
