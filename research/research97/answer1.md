## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question. I need to determine if my answer will have fewer than three words.

If I answer "yes" - that's 1 word, which is less than 3. So "yes" would be truthful.
If I answer "no" - that's 1 word, which is less than 3. So "no" would be false.

The only consistent answer is "yes" because a one-word answer of "yes" correctly describes itself as having fewer than three words.

## Final Answer
Yes
