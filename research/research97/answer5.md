## Reasoning
The question asks whether the number of words in my answer is less than three, and I must answer "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze both options:
- If I answer "yes" - that is 1 word. Is 1 less than 3? Yes. So "yes" would be a true and self-consistent answer.
- If I answer "no" - that is 1 word. Is 1 less than 3? Yes. So "no" would be false and self-contradictory.

Since "yes" is 1 word, and 1 is less than 3, answering "yes" makes the statement true and consistent.

## Final Answer
yes
