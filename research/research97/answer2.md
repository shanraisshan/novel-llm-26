## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is the number of words in your answer to this question less than three? Answer yes or no."

Let me consider both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - This is 1 word. Is 1 less than 3? Yes, it is. So the answer "yes" would be TRUE and self-consistent.

2. If I answer "no" - This is 1 word. Is 1 less than 3? Yes, it is. But "no" claims the number of words is NOT less than 3, which would be FALSE.

Therefore, "yes" is the correct and self-consistent answer.

## Final Answer
Yes
