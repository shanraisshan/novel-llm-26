## Reasoning

Let me work through this riddle step by step:

1. "I follow you everywhere" - This suggests something that constantly accompanies a person wherever they go. Common things that follow us include our reflection, our shadow, or our footsteps.

2. "I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun" - This is the crucial clue. At first, it seems counterintuitive because we might think things would get shorter near the sun. However, when you walk TOWARD the sun (when it's low on the horizon), your shadow stretches out behind you and becomes very long. The lower the sun is in the sky (closer to the horizon, in the direction you're walking), the longer your shadow becomes.

3. When the sun is directly overhead (at noon), shadows are at their shortest. When the sun is near the horizon (at sunrise or sunset), shadows are at their longest. So if you're walking toward the sun when it's low, you're getting "closer" to it while your shadow extends far behind you.

4. A shadow follows you everywhere you go (as long as there's light), which matches the first part of the riddle perfectly.

## Final Answer

A shadow
