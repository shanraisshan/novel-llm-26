## Reasoning

Let me work through this riddle step by step:

1. "I follow you everywhere" - This suggests something that constantly accompanies a person wherever they go.

2. "I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun" - This is the crucial clue. At first, this seems counterintuitive because we might think of getting closer to the sun as midday when the sun is high overhead.

3. However, "closer to the sun" can be interpreted as when the sun is lower on the horizon - during sunrise and sunset, the sun appears closer to you (at eye level, near the horizon). During these times, shadows stretch out and become very long.

4. Conversely, when the sun is directly overhead at noon (furthest from the horizon), shadows are at their shortest.

5. A shadow follows you everywhere you go, and it gets longer when the sun is low on the horizon (appearing "closer" to you) and shorter when the sun is high overhead.

## Final Answer

A shadow.
