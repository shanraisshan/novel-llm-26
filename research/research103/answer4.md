## Reasoning

Let me analyze this riddle step by step:

1. "I follow you everywhere" - This suggests something that constantly accompanies a person wherever they go.

2. "I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun" - This is the crucial clue. At first, this seems counterintuitive because one might think being closer to a light source would make something smaller.

3. However, "closer to the sun" can mean walking toward the sun when it is at a low angle in the sky (near the horizon, such as during sunrise or sunset). When the sun is at a low angle and you walk toward it, your shadow extends behind you and becomes very long.

4. Conversely, when the sun is directly overhead (at noon), shadows are at their shortest.

5. A shadow follows you everywhere you go, and it gets longer when the sun is at a lower angle in the sky - which is when you would be "walking toward" or "getting closer to" the sun on the horizon.

## Final Answer

A shadow
