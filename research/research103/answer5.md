## Reasoning

Let me work through this riddle step by step:

1. "I follow you everywhere" - This suggests something that constantly accompanies a person wherever they go. A shadow fits this perfectly, as it follows you whenever there is a light source.

2. "I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun" - This is the crucial clue. At first, this might seem counterintuitive since we might think shadows get shorter in bright sunlight. However, the phrase "closer you get to the sun" refers to the sun's position relative to the horizon:
   - When the sun is low in the sky (near the horizon at sunrise or sunset), you are "closer" to facing the sun directly
   - At these times, shadows are at their longest because the light hits objects at a low angle
   - When the sun is directly overhead (midday), shadows are shortest

3. The riddle plays on the relationship between the sun's angle and shadow length - the more directly you face the sun (closer to it in terms of angle), the longer your shadow extends behind you.

## Final Answer

A shadow
