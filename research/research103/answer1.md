## Reasoning

Let me analyze this riddle step by step:

1. "I follow you everywhere" - This suggests something that accompanies a person constantly, like a companion or an effect created by the person's presence.

2. "I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun" - This is the crucial clue. At first, this seems counterintuitive because typically shadows get shorter when the sun is higher (closer to directly overhead).

3. However, the riddle says "closer you get to the sun" - not when the sun is higher in the sky. If you physically move closer to the sun (like climbing a mountain, going up in an airplane, or being at higher elevation), the sun's angle relative to you changes.

4. More importantly, thinking about this differently: when the sun is LOW on the horizon (like at sunrise or sunset), shadows are very LONG. As the sun rises higher, shadows get shorter. But the riddle frames it as "closer to the sun."

5. The answer that fits is a SHADOW. A shadow follows you everywhere you go (when there's light). The phrasing "closer to the sun" likely refers to when the sun is lower on the horizon (appearing closer to you on the horizon), which is when shadows are longest.

6. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as your shadow getting longer in the morning as you face toward the rising sun, or in evening facing the setting sun.

## Final Answer

A shadow.
