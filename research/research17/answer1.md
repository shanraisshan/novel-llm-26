# Answer 1

**Answer**: 1

**Reasoning**: To find the last digit of a product, we only need to multiply the last digits of the factors. The last digit of 37 is 7, and the last digit of 43 is 3. Multiplying these: 7 x 3 = 21. The last digit of 21 is 1. (Verification: 37 x 43 = 1591, which indeed ends in 1.)
