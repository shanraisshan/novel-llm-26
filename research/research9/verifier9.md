## Question
"Apples cost $2 each. You have $10 to spend. How many apples can you buy if the store is closed?"

## Expected Correct Answer
0 (You cannot buy anything from a closed store)

## Answers Summary
| Researcher | Answer | Correct? |
|------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | 0 | Yes |
| 2 | 0 | Yes |
| 3 | 0 | Yes |
| 4 | 0 | Yes |
| 5 | 0 | Yes |

## Consensus Analysis

All 5 researchers correctly identified the trick in this question. Despite the mathematical setup suggesting a division problem ($10 / $2 = 5 apples), each researcher recognized the critical constraint: the store is closed.

### Key Observations:
- **100% agreement** on the correct answer of 0
- All researchers avoided the mathematical trap of answering "5 apples"
- Each researcher demonstrated practical reasoning by recognizing that a closed store means no purchases are possible
- The question tests whether LLMs focus solely on mathematical operations or consider real-world constraints

### Why This Question Matters:
This is a classic "trick question" designed to test whether AI models:
1. Read the entire problem before solving
2. Consider practical/contextual constraints
3. Avoid blindly applying mathematical formulas

## Final Score
**Consensus Score: 100%**

## Conclusion

**The question FAILED to break the LLMs.**

All 5 AI researchers correctly answered this trick question. The question was designed to test whether LLMs would fall for the mathematical distraction (calculating $10 / $2 = 5 apples) while ignoring the crucial detail that the store is closed. However, all researchers demonstrated strong reading comprehension and practical reasoning by correctly answering 0.

This suggests that modern LLMs are capable of:
- Identifying contextual constraints that override mathematical calculations
- Recognizing trick questions that test attention to detail
- Applying common-sense reasoning to word problems

The unanimous correct response indicates this particular type of trick question is no longer effective at "breaking" current AI models.
