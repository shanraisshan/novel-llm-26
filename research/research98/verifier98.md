## Correct Answer
Yes

## Summary of Each Answer

### Answer 1
- **Final Answer**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: Analyzed both possible responses and determined that "Yes" is the only consistent and truthful answer because it is exactly one sentence and correctly describes itself as being exactly one sentence.
- **Correct**: YES

### Answer 2
- **Final Answer**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: Analyzed both possibilities and concluded that "Yes" is the only logically consistent answer because the word "Yes" constitutes exactly one sentence and correctly describes itself.
- **Correct**: YES

### Answer 3
- **Final Answer**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: Examined both possible answers and determined that "Yes" is logically consistent because the answer is exactly one sentence, making the claim true and self-consistent.
- **Correct**: YES

### Answer 4
- **Final Answer**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: Considered both options and concluded that "Yes" creates a consistent, truthful response while "No" would create a contradiction.
- **Correct**: YES

### Answer 5
- **Final Answer**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: Analyzed both possible answers and determined that "Yes" is the only logically consistent answer - it is one sentence and correctly states that fact.
- **Correct**: YES

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All 5 answers unanimously agree that "Yes" is the correct answer. Each answer independently arrived at the same conclusion through similar self-referential logic analysis.

### Areas of Disagreement
None. All answers are in complete agreement.

### Quality Assessment
All 5 answers demonstrated solid reasoning:
- Each recognized the self-referential nature of the question
- Each analyzed both possible responses (Yes and No)
- Each correctly identified that "Yes" is self-consistent while "No" would be contradictory
- The reasoning was clear and well-structured in all cases

## Final Synthesized Answer

**Yes** is the correct answer to this self-referential question. The logic is straightforward:

1. The question asks if the answer will be exactly one sentence
2. If we answer "Yes" - this is one sentence, and the claim is true (consistent)
3. If we answer "No" - this is also one sentence, but the claim is false (contradictory)

Therefore, "Yes" is the only logically consistent and truthful response.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score**: 100%
