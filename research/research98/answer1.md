## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question exactly one sentence? Answer yes or no."

This is a self-referential question about the length of my own answer. Let me analyze both possible responses:

1. If I answer "Yes" - This response is exactly one sentence. Since my answer IS one sentence, saying "Yes" would be truthful and consistent.

2. If I answer "No" - This response is also exactly one sentence. But if my answer is one sentence and I say "No," that would be false and inconsistent.

Therefore, "Yes" is the only consistent and truthful answer, because:
- It is exactly one sentence
- It correctly describes itself as being exactly one sentence

## Final Answer
Yes
