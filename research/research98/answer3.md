## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question asking whether my answer will be exactly one sentence, requiring a yes or no response.

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "Yes" - This response is exactly one sentence (one word counts as a sentence). Since my answer IS one sentence, saying "Yes" would be truthful and consistent.

2. If I answer "No" - This response is also exactly one sentence. But if my answer is one sentence and I claim it is NOT one sentence, that would be a contradiction and false.

Therefore, the logically consistent answer is "Yes" because:
- The answer "Yes" is exactly one sentence
- This makes the claim true and self-consistent

## Final Answer
Yes
