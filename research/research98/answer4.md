## Reasoning
The question asks whether my answer is exactly one sentence, requiring a yes or no response.

This is a self-referential question. Let me consider both options:
- If I answer "Yes" - this is exactly one sentence, so the statement would be true
- If I answer "No" - this is also exactly one sentence, so the statement would be false

Since "Yes" creates a consistent, truthful response (it is one sentence and correctly describes itself as one sentence), while "No" creates a contradiction (it claims not to be one sentence while being one sentence), the logically consistent answer is "Yes."

## Final Answer
Yes
