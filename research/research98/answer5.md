## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question asking whether my answer will be exactly one sentence.

Let me analyze both possible answers:
1. If I answer "Yes" - This is exactly one sentence (one word). The answer would be TRUE because my response is indeed one sentence.
2. If I answer "No" - This is also exactly one sentence. But the answer would be FALSE because my response IS one sentence, making "No" incorrect.

The only logically consistent answer is "Yes" - it is one sentence, and it correctly states that fact.

## Final Answer
Yes
