## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question asking whether my answer will be exactly one sentence, with a required yes or no response.

Let me analyze both possibilities:
1. If I answer "Yes" - this is exactly one sentence, and it claims to be exactly one sentence, making it TRUE and consistent.
2. If I answer "No" - this is exactly one sentence, but it claims NOT to be exactly one sentence, making it FALSE and inconsistent.

The only logically consistent answer is "Yes" because:
- The word "Yes" constitutes exactly one sentence
- It correctly describes itself as being exactly one sentence

## Final Answer
Yes
