## Reasoning
1. The problem states that Tom is standing directly behind Sarah in a line.
2. If Tom is directly behind Sarah, then by definition, Sarah must be directly in front of Tom.
3. The relationship "behind" and "in front of" are opposites - if A is behind B, then B is in front of A.

## Final Answer
Sarah
