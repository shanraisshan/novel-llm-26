## Conclusion
This question did not cause any disagreement among the agents. All 5 agents correctly reasoned that if Tom is standing directly behind Sarah in a line, then Sarah must be standing directly in front of Tom. The logical relationship between "behind" and "in front of" is straightforward and well-understood by all agents. This question tests basic spatial reasoning but does not appear to be a tricky or ambiguous problem that would cause LLMs to disagree.
