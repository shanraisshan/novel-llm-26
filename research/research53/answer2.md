## Reasoning
Let me think through this step by step:

1. We are told that Tom is standing directly behind Sarah in a line.
2. If Tom is directly behind Sarah, this means Sarah is directly in front of Tom.
3. The question asks: "Who is standing directly in front of Tom?"
4. Since Tom is directly behind Sarah, the person directly in front of Tom must be Sarah.

## Final Answer
Sarah
