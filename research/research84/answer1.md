## Reasoning

Let me analyze the word "SKILLFULLY" step by step to count the letter pair "LL":

1. First, I'll write out the word letter by letter with positions:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 2: K
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 4: L
   - Position 5: L
   - Position 6: F
   - Position 7: U
   - Position 8: L
   - Position 9: L
   - Position 10: Y

2. Now I'll scan for consecutive "LL" pairs:
   - Positions 4-5: L-L (this is the first "LL" pair, in "SKILL")
   - Positions 8-9: L-L (this is the second "LL" pair, in "FULLY")

3. The word breaks down as: SKILL + FULLY, and each part contains one "LL" pair.

## Final Answer
