## Reasoning

Let me analyze the word 'SKILLFULLY' letter by letter:

S - K - I - L - L - F - U - L - L - Y
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10

Now I'll look for consecutive 'LL' pairs:

1. Position 4-5: L-L (this is the first 'LL' pair, in "SKILL")
2. Position 8-9: L-L (this is the second 'LL' pair, in "FULLY")

So the word SKILLFULLY contains two instances of the letter pair 'LL'.

## Final Answer
