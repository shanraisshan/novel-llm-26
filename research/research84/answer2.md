## Reasoning

Let me spell out the word 'SKILLFULLY' letter by letter to count the 'LL' pairs:

S - K - I - L - L - F - U - L - L - Y

Position 1: S
Position 2: K
Position 3: I
Position 4: L
Position 5: L
Position 6: F
Position 7: U
Position 8: L
Position 9: L
Position 10: Y

Now I'll look for consecutive 'LL' pairs:
- Positions 4-5: L-L (first occurrence)
- Positions 8-9: L-L (second occurrence)

## Final Answer
