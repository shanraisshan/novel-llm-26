## Reasoning
The word "TEETH" is the irregular plural form of "TOOTH." In English, when referring to a single tooth, we use the singular form "tooth." When referring to more than one, we use "teeth." This is an example of an irregular plural noun in English, where the vowel sound changes (oo to ee) rather than simply adding an "-s" or "-es" suffix.

For example:
- "I have a loose tooth." (singular - one tooth)
- "I brush my teeth twice a day." (plural - multiple teeth)

## Final Answer
Plural
