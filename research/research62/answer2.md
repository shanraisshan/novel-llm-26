## Reasoning

To determine whether "TEETH" is singular or plural, I need to consider its relationship to its base form:

1. The word "TOOTH" refers to one single tooth - a hard, calcified structure in the mouth used for biting and chewing.

2. The word "TEETH" is the plural form of "TOOTH". This is an irregular plural in English where the vowel sound changes from "oo" to "ee" (a pattern called vowel mutation or ablaut).

3. This same pattern appears in other English words:
   - foot -> feet
   - goose -> geese

4. When we say "teeth," we are referring to more than one tooth.

## Final Answer

The word "TEETH" is **plural**. It is the irregular plural form of the singular word "tooth."
