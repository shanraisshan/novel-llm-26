## Reasoning

To determine whether "TEETH" is singular or plural, I need to consider its relationship to the word "tooth":

1. "Tooth" is the singular form, referring to one individual tooth in the mouth.
2. "Teeth" is the plural form, referring to multiple teeth.
3. This is an example of an irregular plural in English, where instead of adding "-s" or "-es" to form the plural, the vowel sound changes from "oo" to "ee" (similar to foot/feet, goose/geese).

## Final Answer

The word "TEETH" is **plural**. It is the irregular plural form of "tooth."
