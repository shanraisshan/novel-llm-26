## Conclusion

All five independent researchers unanimously and correctly identified "TEETH" as the plural form. Each answer demonstrated strong reasoning by:

1. Identifying "tooth" as the singular form and "teeth" as its plural counterpart
2. Recognizing this as an example of an irregular plural in English
3. Explaining the vowel mutation pattern (oo to ee) used instead of standard -s/-es suffixes
4. Providing analogous examples (foot/feet, goose/geese) to illustrate the pattern

This is a straightforward linguistic question with complete consensus. The answer "Plural" is unambiguously correct.
