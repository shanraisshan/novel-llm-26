## Reasoning

To determine whether "TEETH" is singular or plural, I need to consider its grammatical form:

1. The word "tooth" is the singular form, referring to a single tooth (one of the hard structures in the mouth used for biting and chewing).

2. The word "teeth" is the plural form of "tooth," referring to more than one tooth.

3. This is an example of an irregular plural in English. Instead of adding "-s" or "-es" to form the plural (which would incorrectly give us "tooths"), English uses a vowel change from "oo" to "ee" - a pattern seen in other words like:
   - foot -> feet
   - goose -> geese

4. When we say "I have teeth" or "my teeth hurt," we are referring to multiple teeth, not just one.

## Final Answer

The word "TEETH" is **plural**. It is the irregular plural form of "tooth."
