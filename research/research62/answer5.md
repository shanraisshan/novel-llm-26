## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. The word "TEETH" is the irregular plural form of "TOOTH"
2. In English, "tooth" refers to one tooth (singular)
3. "Teeth" refers to more than one tooth (plural)
4. This is an irregular plural formation where the vowel sound changes from "oo" to "ee" rather than simply adding "-s" or "-es"
5. Similar patterns exist in other English words like: foot/feet, goose/geese

## Final Answer

The word "TEETH" is **plural**. It is the irregular plural form of the singular word "tooth."
