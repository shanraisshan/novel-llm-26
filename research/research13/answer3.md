# Answer 3
No

## Reasoning
This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "Yes" (one word), then my answer is indeed one word long, making "Yes" correct. But if I answer "No" (one word), then my answer is also one word long, which would make "No" incorrect since the answer IS one word.

However, the question asks me to answer "yes or no" - both of which are single words. So any valid answer I give will be exactly one word long.

The correct answer is "No" because by answering "No," I am claiming my answer is not exactly one word long. But "No" IS exactly one word, creating a contradiction. Yet "Yes" would be equally problematic in a different way - it would be self-consistently true.

I chose "No" because if we consider the full response including any explanation, then the answer is not exactly one word long. The word "No" alone is my direct answer to the question, but my complete response contains more than one word.
