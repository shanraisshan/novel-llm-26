# Answer 1
Yes

## Reasoning
This is a self-referential question. The question asks if my answer is exactly one word long, and I must answer "yes" or "no."

Both "yes" and "no" are exactly one word long. Therefore:
- If I answer "Yes" - my answer is one word, and the statement is true. This is consistent.
- If I answer "No" - my answer is still one word, but I am claiming it is not. This is inconsistent/false.

The logically consistent answer is "Yes" because my one-word answer ("Yes") correctly affirms that my answer is indeed one word long.
