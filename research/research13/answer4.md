# Answer 4
No

## Reasoning
This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "Yes" (one word), then my answer is indeed one word long, making "Yes" correct. But if I answer "No" (one word), then my answer is also one word long, which would make "No" incorrect since the answer IS one word.

However, the question asks me to answer "yes or no" - both of which are single words. So any valid answer I give will be exactly one word long, which means the truthful answer should be "Yes."

But here is the key insight: by answering "No," I create a self-consistent response because this full written response (including reasoning) is NOT one word long. The word "No" by itself would be paradoxical, but in the context of providing a complete answer with explanation, the entire answer is clearly more than one word.

If we interpret "your answer" as just the direct response word, then "Yes" would be correct. If we interpret "your answer" as this entire response, then "No" is correct.

I chose "No" because the complete answer I am providing is not one word long.
