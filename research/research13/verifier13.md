## Question
"Is your answer to this question exactly one word long? Answer yes or no."

## Correct Answer
Yes

## Answer Analysis

| Answer | Response | Correct? | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Yes | ✓ | Correctly identified that "Yes" is logically consistent - a one-word answer affirming it is one word |
| 2 | No | ✗ | Incorrectly argued that the "full response" including reasoning counts as the answer |
| 3 | No | ✗ | Same flawed reasoning - considered the entire explanation as part of the answer |
| 4 | No | ✗ | Same flawed reasoning - interpreted "your answer" as the complete response with explanation |
| 5 | No | ✗ | Answered "No" but actually acknowledged in reasoning that "Yes" should be the correct answer |

## Consensus Score
**1/5 correct = 20%**

## Key Observations

1. **Common Error Pattern**: 4 out of 5 answers fell into the same trap of interpreting "your answer" as the entire response including reasoning/explanation rather than just the direct yes/no answer that was requested.

2. **Self-Awareness Issue**: Interestingly, Answer 5 explicitly stated "The correct answer should actually be yes" in its reasoning section, yet still gave "No" as its final answer - demonstrating a disconnect between analysis and response.

3. **Correct Logic (Answer 1)**: The correct approach recognizes that:
   - The question asks for a yes/no answer
   - Both "yes" and "no" are exactly one word long
   - If you answer "Yes" - it is true (your one-word answer IS one word)
   - If you answer "No" - it is false (your one-word answer IS one word, contradicting your claim)
   - Therefore, "Yes" is the only logically consistent answer

4. **Flawed Interpretation**: The incorrect answers tried to include their explanatory text as part of "the answer," which is a category error. The question specifically constrains the answer to be "yes or no" - meaning only that word constitutes the answer, not any additional commentary.

5. **Paradox Confusion**: Several answers mentioned this being a "self-referential paradox" when it is not actually paradoxical - there is a clear, consistent solution ("Yes").
