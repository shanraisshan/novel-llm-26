# Answer 2
No

## Reasoning
This is a self-referential paradox. If I answer "Yes" (one word), then my answer is indeed one word long, making "Yes" correct. But if I answer "No" (one word), then my answer is also one word long, which would make "No" incorrect since the answer IS one word.

However, the question asks me to answer "yes or no" - both of which are single words. So any valid answer I give will be exactly one word long, which means the truthful answer should be "Yes."

But here is the key insight: I am providing this answer with reasoning and explanation, not just the single word. My complete response to this question is NOT one word long - it includes this entire explanation. Therefore, "No" is the accurate answer because my full answer (including this reasoning) is not exactly one word long.

The word "No" by itself would be one word, but my actual answer to the question as a whole is not one word long.
