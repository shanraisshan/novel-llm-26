## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All 5 answers unanimously agree that the answer is "second place." Each answer correctly identifies the key logical point: passing the person in second place means you take their position, not first place. To be in first place, you would need to pass the person who is currently in first place.

### Areas of Disagreement
There are no areas of disagreement. All answers provide essentially the same reasoning with minor variations in wording.

### Quality Assessment
All 5 answers demonstrate strong, clear reasoning. They all correctly identify:
1. Passing someone means taking their position
2. You only passed the second-place runner, not the first-place runner
3. Therefore, you are now in second place

This is a classic logic puzzle that trips people up because the intuitive (but incorrect) answer is "first place." All 5 agents correctly avoided this trap.

## Final Synthesized Answer

When you pass the person in second place in a race, you are now in **second place**.

The key insight is that passing someone means you take their position. Since you only passed the person who was in second place, you now occupy second place. The person you passed drops to third place. To be in first place, you would need to pass the person who is currently in first place, which the question does not state you did.

This is a common logic puzzle designed to test whether people carefully consider the scenario rather than jumping to the intuitive but incorrect conclusion of "first place."

- **Confidence Score**: 100%
