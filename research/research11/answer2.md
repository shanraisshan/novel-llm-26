# Answer 2

## My Answer
You are in second place.

## My Reasoning
When you pass the person who is in second place, you take their position. You do not move into first place because you only passed the second-place runner, not the first-place runner. The person you passed now falls to third place, and you assume the second-place position they previously held.
