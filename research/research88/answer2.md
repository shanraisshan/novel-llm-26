## Reasoning
The question asks whether my answer contains more than two words, and I must answer "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:
- If I answer "yes" - that is one word. One word is not more than two words, so "yes" would be false.
- If I answer "no" - that is one word. One word is not more than two words, so "no" would be true.

Since "no" (a single word) correctly states that my answer does not contain more than two words, "no" is the consistent and truthful answer.

## Final Answer
No
