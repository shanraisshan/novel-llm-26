## Reasoning

The question asks: "Does your answer to this question contain more than two words? Answer yes or no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - that is one word. One word is NOT more than two words. So saying "yes" would be false/inconsistent.

2. If I answer "no" - that is one word. One word is NOT more than two words. So saying "no" would be true/consistent.

Since a one-word answer ("no") does not contain more than two words, the answer "no" is self-consistent and correct.

## Final Answer

no
