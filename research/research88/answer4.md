## Reasoning
The question asks: "Does your answer to this question contain more than two words? Answer yes or no."

This is a self-referential question. I need to consider what happens with each possible answer:

1. If I answer "yes" - that is one word. One word is NOT more than two words. So saying "yes" would be false/inconsistent.

2. If I answer "no" - that is one word. One word is NOT more than two words. So saying "no" would be true/consistent.

Since a one-word answer ("no") does not contain more than two words, the answer "no" is the correct and self-consistent response.

## Final Answer
No
