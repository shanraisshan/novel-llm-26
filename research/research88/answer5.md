## Reasoning

The question asks: "Does your answer to this question contain more than two words? Answer yes or no."

This is a self-referential question. I need to consider what my answer will be:

1. If I answer "yes" - that is one word. One word is NOT more than two words. So saying "yes" would be false.

2. If I answer "no" - that is one word. One word is NOT more than two words. So saying "no" would be true.

Since a one-word answer like "no" does not contain more than two words, the correct and consistent answer is "no."

## Final Answer

No
