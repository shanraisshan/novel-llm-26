## Reasoning
The question asks whether my answer contains more than two words, and I must respond with "yes" or "no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:
- If I answer "yes" - that is one word. One word is not more than two words, so saying "yes" would be incorrect/inconsistent.
- If I answer "no" - that is one word. One word is not more than two words, so saying "no" would be correct/consistent.

Since a one-word answer ("no") does not contain more than two words, the answer "no" is self-consistent and truthful.

## Final Answer
No
