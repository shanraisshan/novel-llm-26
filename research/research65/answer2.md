## Reasoning

Let me think through where the hour hand points at 9:45 on an analog clock.

1. At exactly 9:00, the hour hand points directly at the 9.

2. The hour hand moves gradually as minutes pass. It takes 60 minutes for the hour hand to move from one number to the next.

3. At 9:45, 45 minutes have passed since 9:00. This means the hour hand has moved 45/60 = 3/4 of the way from 9 toward 10.

4. Since the hour hand is 3/4 of the way between 9 and 10, it is much closer to 10 than to 9.

5. To be precise: the hour hand is 1/4 of the distance away from the 10, and 3/4 of the distance away from the 9.

Therefore, at 9:45, the hour hand is pointing closest to the number 10.

## Final Answer

10
