## Reasoning

Let me think through where the hour hand points at 9:45 on an analog clock.

1. At exactly 9:00, the hour hand points directly at the 9.

2. The hour hand moves continuously as time passes. It takes 12 hours to complete one full rotation around the clock face.

3. In one hour, the hour hand moves from one number to the next (e.g., from 9 to 10). This means it moves 1/12 of the clock face per hour.

4. At 9:45, we are 45 minutes past 9:00, which is 3/4 of an hour (45/60 = 3/4).

5. So the hour hand has moved 3/4 of the way from the 9 toward the 10.

6. Since the hour hand is 3/4 of the way between 9 and 10, it is closer to 10 than to 9.

7. Specifically, it is 3/4 of the way to 10, meaning it is only 1/4 of the distance away from 10, but 3/4 of the distance away from 9.

## Final Answer

The hour hand is pointing closest to the number 10.
