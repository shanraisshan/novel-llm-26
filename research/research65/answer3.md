## Reasoning

Let me think through where the hour hand points at 9:45 on an analog clock.

1. On an analog clock, the hour hand moves gradually between numbers as time passes within each hour.

2. At exactly 9:00, the hour hand points directly at the 9.

3. At exactly 10:00, the hour hand would point directly at the 10.

4. At 9:45, we are 45 minutes into the hour, which is 3/4 of the way through the hour (45/60 = 3/4 = 0.75).

5. This means the hour hand has moved 3/4 of the way from the 9 toward the 10.

6. The hour hand is therefore positioned at 9 + (3/4) = 9.75 on the clock face.

7. Since 9.75 is closer to 10 than to 9 (it's only 0.25 away from 10, but 0.75 away from 9), the hour hand is pointing closest to the 10.

## Final Answer

The hour hand is pointing closest to the **10**.
