## Reasoning

Let me think through where the hour hand points at 9:45 on an analog clock.

1. At exactly 9:00, the hour hand points directly at the 9.

2. The hour hand moves gradually between numbers as time passes. It takes 1 hour (60 minutes) for the hour hand to move from one number to the next number on the clock.

3. At 9:45, 45 minutes have passed since 9:00. This means the hour hand has moved 45/60 = 3/4 of the way from the 9 toward the 10.

4. Since the hour hand is 3/4 of the way between 9 and 10, it is much closer to 10 than to 9.

5. To be precise: the hour hand is only 1/4 of the distance away from 10, but 3/4 of the distance away from 9.

## Final Answer

The hour hand is pointing closest to the number 10.
