## Reasoning

Let me think through where the hour hand is at 9:45 on an analog clock.

1. At exactly 9:00, the hour hand points directly at the 9.

2. The hour hand moves gradually as minutes pass. In one hour (60 minutes), the hour hand moves from one number to the next (e.g., from 9 to 10).

3. At 9:45, 45 minutes have passed since 9:00. This means the hour hand has moved 45/60 = 3/4 of the way from 9 toward 10.

4. Since the hour hand is 3/4 of the way between 9 and 10, it is much closer to 10 than to 9.

5. To be more precise: the hour hand is only 1/4 of the distance away from 10, but 3/4 of the distance away from 9.

## Final Answer

The hour hand is pointing closest to **10**.
