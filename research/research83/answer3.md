## Reasoning
To determine which word comes last alphabetically between "AND" and "AN":

1. Both words start with the same two letters: A-N
2. "AN" has 2 letters (A, N)
3. "AND" has 3 letters (A, N, D)
4. When comparing alphabetically, we compare letter by letter from left to right
5. First letter: A = A (identical)
6. Second letter: N = N (identical)
7. Third letter: "AN" ends here, while "AND" continues with D
8. In standard alphabetical ordering, when one word is a prefix of another, the shorter word comes first
9. Therefore: "AN" comes before "AND"

## Final Answer
AND
