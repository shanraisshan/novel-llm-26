## Reasoning
To determine which word comes last alphabetically between 'AND' and 'AN':

1. Both words start with the letter 'A'
2. Both words have 'N' as the second letter
3. 'AN' has only 2 letters and ends there
4. 'AND' has a third letter 'D'
5. When comparing words alphabetically, if one word is a prefix of another, the shorter word comes first
6. Since 'AN' is a prefix of 'AND', 'AN' comes before 'AND' in alphabetical order
7. Therefore, 'AND' comes LAST alphabetically

## Final Answer
AND
