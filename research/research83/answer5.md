## Reasoning
To determine which word comes last alphabetically between 'AND' and 'AN':

1. Compare the first letter: Both words start with 'A' - they are equal
2. Compare the second letter: Both words have 'N' as the second letter - they are equal
3. Compare the third letter: 'AN' has no third letter (it ends after 2 letters), while 'AND' has 'D' as the third letter
4. In alphabetical ordering, when one word is a prefix of another, the shorter word comes first and the longer word comes after

Therefore, 'AN' comes before 'AND' in alphabetical order, which means 'AND' comes LAST alphabetically.

## Final Answer
AND
