## Analysis
All five agents correctly identified that 'AND' comes LAST alphabetically when compared to 'AN'. The reasoning was highly consistent across all answers, with each agent correctly applying the standard alphabetical ordering rule: when one word is a prefix of another (i.e., 'AN' is a prefix of 'AND'), the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order.

The agents approached the problem through letter-by-letter comparison, noting that both words share the same first two letters ('A' and 'N'), but 'AND' continues with a third letter ('D') while 'AN' terminates. In standard dictionary ordering, the absence of a character is treated as coming before any character, placing the shorter prefix word ('AN') before the longer word ('AND'). Therefore, 'AND' comes LAST.

This represents perfect consensus with sound, uniform reasoning across all independent answers.
