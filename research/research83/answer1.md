## Reasoning
To determine which word comes last alphabetically between 'AND' and 'AN', I need to compare them letter by letter.

1. First letter: Both words start with 'A' - they are equal.
2. Second letter: Both words have 'N' as the second letter - they are equal.
3. Third letter: 'AND' has 'D' as the third letter, while 'AN' has no third letter (it ends after 'N').

In alphabetical ordering, when one word is a prefix of another, the shorter word comes first. This is because the absence of a character is considered to come before any character.

Therefore, 'AN' comes before 'AND' alphabetically.

This means 'AND' comes LAST alphabetically.

## Final Answer
AND
