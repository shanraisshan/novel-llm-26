## Notes
All 5 independent researchers correctly identified that the sentence contains 7 words, not 6 as the sentence falsely claims about itself. Each researcher methodically counted the words (There, are, six, words, in, this, sentence) and arrived at the correct answer of 7. All researchers also correctly noted that this is a self-referential paradox where the sentence makes a false claim about itself.

Since all LLMs answered correctly (100% score), this question failed to stump them and is not suitable for the novel question set.
