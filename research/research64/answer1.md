## Reasoning

I need to count the words in the sentence: "There are six words in this sentence."

Let me count each word one by one:
1. There
2. are
3. six
4. words
5. in
6. this
7. sentence

The sentence contains 7 words total.

Note: The sentence itself claims to have "six words," but this is a self-referential paradox. The actual count of words in the sentence is 7, not 6. The sentence is making a false claim about itself.

## Final Answer

7 words
