## Reasoning

I need to count the words in the sentence: "There are six words in this sentence."

Let me count each word:
1. There
2. are
3. six
4. words
5. in
6. this
7. sentence

The sentence claims to have six words, but when I actually count them, there are 7 words.

## Final Answer

7 words

(Note: The sentence is self-referentially false - it claims to have six words, but it actually contains seven words.)
