## Reasoning

I need to count the words in the sentence: "There are six words in this sentence."

Let me count each word one by one:
1. There
2. are
3. six
4. words
5. in
6. this
7. sentence

The sentence contains 7 words total.

Note: The sentence itself claims "There are six words in this sentence" - but this is a self-referential paradox. The statement is actually false because the sentence contains 7 words, not 6.

## Final Answer

7 words
