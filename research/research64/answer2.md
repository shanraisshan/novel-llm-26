## Reasoning

I need to count the words in the sentence: "There are six words in this sentence."

Let me count each word:
1. There
2. are
3. six
4. words
5. in
6. this
7. sentence

Counting through the sentence word by word, I arrive at 7 words total.

Note: The sentence itself claims "There are six words in this sentence" - but this is a self-referential paradox. The sentence is actually false because it contains 7 words, not 6. This is similar to the classic liar's paradox.

## Final Answer

7 words
