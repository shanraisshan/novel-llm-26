## Reasoning

Let me compare the two amounts of money:

1. Left pocket: $9.9 - This means 9 dollars and 90 cents, which can also be written as $9.90
2. Right pocket: $9.11 - This means 9 dollars and 11 cents

Now comparing:
- $9.90 (left pocket) vs $9.11 (right pocket)
- $9.90 is greater than $9.11

The difference is $9.90 - $9.11 = $0.79 (79 cents)

## Final Answer

The left pocket has more money. $9.9 (which equals $9.90 or 9 dollars and 90 cents) is greater than $9.11 (9 dollars and 11 cents).
