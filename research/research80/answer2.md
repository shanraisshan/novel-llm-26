## Reasoning

Let me compare the two amounts of money:

- Left pocket: $9.9
- Right pocket: $9.11

The key here is understanding decimal notation for money:
- $9.9 means 9 dollars and 90 cents (written as $9.90)
- $9.11 means 9 dollars and 11 cents

Comparing the two:
- $9.90 (left pocket) = 990 cents
- $9.11 (right pocket) = 911 cents

990 cents > 911 cents

## Final Answer

The left pocket has more money. $9.9 (which equals $9.90 or nine dollars and ninety cents) is greater than $9.11 (nine dollars and eleven cents).
