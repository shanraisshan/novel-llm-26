## Reasoning

Let me compare the two amounts of money:

1. Left pocket: $9.9 (which is nine dollars and ninety cents, or $9.90)
2. Right pocket: $9.11 (which is nine dollars and eleven cents)

Converting both to cents for easy comparison:
- $9.90 = 990 cents
- $9.11 = 911 cents

990 cents > 911 cents

Note: The notation "$9.9" might look smaller than "$9.11" if you mistakenly compare them like decimal numbers (where 9.11 > 9.9 would be wrong thinking). But in currency, $9.9 means $9.90, not $9.10. The ".9" represents 90 cents, not 9 cents.

## Final Answer

The left pocket has more money. $9.90 is greater than $9.11 by 79 cents.
