## Reasoning

Let me carefully analyze the amounts in each pocket:

1. Left pocket: $9.9
   - This is nine dollars and ninety cents ($9.90)

2. Right pocket: $9.11
   - This is nine dollars and eleven cents ($9.11)

Now comparing:
- $9.90 (left pocket) vs $9.11 (right pocket)
- $9.90 is greater than $9.11
- The difference is $0.79

## Final Answer

The left pocket has more money. $9.9 (which equals $9.90, or nine dollars and ninety cents) is greater than $9.11 (nine dollars and eleven cents).
