## Reasoning

Let me analyze the amounts in each pocket:

1. Left pocket: $9.9 - This is nine dollars and ninety cents ($9.90)
2. Right pocket: $9.11 - This is nine dollars and eleven cents ($9.11)

Now comparing the two amounts:
- $9.90 (left pocket)
- $9.11 (right pocket)

Both pockets have 9 whole dollars. The difference is in the cents:
- Left pocket has 90 cents
- Right pocket has 11 cents

90 cents is greater than 11 cents.

Note: The notation "$9.9" might look smaller than "$9.11" if you mistakenly compare them as if the numbers after the decimal are integers (9 vs 11), but in currency notation, $9.9 means $9.90, not $9.09.

## Final Answer

The left pocket has more money. $9.90 is greater than $9.11.
