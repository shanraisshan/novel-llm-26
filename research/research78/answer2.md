## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. You are facing me, which means we are looking at each other.

2. When two people face each other, their left and right sides are mirrored/reversed relative to each other.

3. You raise YOUR right hand. From your perspective, your right hand is on your right side.

4. But since we are facing each other, what is on YOUR right side appears on MY left side.

5. So when you raise your right hand while facing me, that hand appears in my LEFT field of vision.

## Final Answer

Your right hand is on MY LEFT side (in my left field of vision).
