## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. The scenario: You are facing me, and you raise your right hand.

2. Since we are facing each other, we are oriented in opposite directions. This means our left and right sides are mirrored relative to each other.

3. Your right hand is on YOUR right side (from your perspective).

4. But since we are facing each other, your right side is on MY left side (from my perspective).

5. Therefore, when you raise your right hand while facing me, that hand appears on the LEFT side of my field of vision.

## Final Answer

Your right hand is on MY LEFT side of my field of vision.
