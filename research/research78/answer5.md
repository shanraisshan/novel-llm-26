## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. The scenario: I am facing you, and you raise your right hand.

2. When two people face each other, their left and right sides are mirrored/reversed relative to each other.

3. Your right hand is on YOUR right side (from your perspective).

4. Since we are facing each other, what is on your right side appears on MY left side.

5. So when you raise your right hand, from my perspective (looking at you), your raised hand appears on the left side of my field of vision.

## Final Answer

Your right hand is on my LEFT side (the left side of my field of vision).
