## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete sentence? Answer yes or no."

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The question instructs me to answer with either "yes" or "no"
2. If I answer "yes" - this is not a complete sentence (it lacks a subject and verb in standard form)
3. If I answer "no" - this is also not a complete sentence

So the question creates a self-referential situation:
- If I say "yes" (claiming my answer is a complete sentence), then I am wrong because "yes" by itself is not a complete sentence
- If I say "no" (claiming my answer is not a complete sentence), then I am correct because "no" by itself is indeed not a complete sentence

The logically consistent answer is "no" because:
- "No" is not a complete sentence (it lacks subject-verb structure)
- By answering "no," I am truthfully stating that my answer is not a complete sentence
- This makes "no" the self-consistent, truthful response

## Final Answer

No
