## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete sentence? Answer yes or no."

This is a self-referential paradox:

1. The question constrains me to answer with only "yes" or "no"
2. If I answer "Yes" - I'm claiming that "Yes" is a complete sentence. Linguistically, "Yes" and "No" can be considered complete sentences as they are grammatically acceptable responses that convey complete meaning (they function as pro-sentences standing in for a full declarative sentence).
3. If I answer "No" - I'm claiming my answer is not a complete sentence, which would make this statement true, but then I've given a truthful answer that is not a complete sentence.

In formal grammar, single-word responses like "Yes" and "No" are often classified as minor sentences or pro-sentences - they are grammatically complete in context because they substitute for a full sentence (e.g., "Yes" = "Yes, my answer is a complete sentence").

Given that "Yes" and "No" are conventionally accepted as complete (if minimal) sentences in response to yes/no questions, and this acceptance is standard in English usage:

## Final Answer

Yes
