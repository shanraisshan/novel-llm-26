## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete sentence? Answer yes or no."

This is a self-referential paradox-like question. Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. **If I answer "Yes"**: I'm claiming that "Yes" is a complete sentence. In traditional grammar, a complete sentence requires a subject and a predicate (verb). The word "Yes" alone lacks these explicit components. However, "Yes" can be considered a minor sentence or a sentence fragment that functions as a complete thought in response to a question.

2. **If I answer "No"**: I'm claiming that "No" is not a complete sentence. By the same strict grammatical standard, "No" is also not a complete sentence with subject and predicate. This answer would be self-consistent - "No" correctly identifies that "No" is not a complete sentence in the traditional sense.

The key insight is that if I answer "No," my answer is truthful and consistent: "No" is not a complete sentence (in the strict grammatical sense), and I'm correctly stating that my answer is not a complete sentence.

If I answer "Yes," my answer would be inconsistent: "Yes" alone is not a complete sentence in the strict sense, yet I would be claiming it is.

Therefore, "No" is the logically consistent answer.

## Final Answer

No
