## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete sentence? Answer yes or no."

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The question asks me to answer "yes" or "no"
2. If I answer "yes" - this is not a complete sentence (it lacks a subject and verb in the traditional sense, though it can be considered a complete response)
3. If I answer "no" - this is also not a complete sentence

The word "yes" or "no" by themselves are technically not complete sentences in the grammatical sense. A complete sentence requires a subject and a predicate (verb). "Yes" and "no" are interjections or sentence fragments used as responses.

So if I answer "yes" (claiming my answer IS a complete sentence), I would be wrong because "yes" is not a complete sentence.

If I answer "no" (claiming my answer is NOT a complete sentence), I would be correct because "no" is indeed not a complete sentence.

Therefore, the logically consistent answer is "no" - because the single word "no" is not a complete sentence, making the statement true.

## Final Answer

No
