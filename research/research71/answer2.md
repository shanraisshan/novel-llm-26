## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete sentence? Answer yes or no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - The word "yes" by itself is not a complete sentence (it lacks a subject and predicate). So if I say "yes," I would be claiming my answer IS a complete sentence when it actually is not. This would be false.

2. If I answer "no" - The word "no" by itself is also not a complete sentence. So if I say "no," I would be claiming my answer is NOT a complete sentence, which is true - "no" is indeed not a complete sentence.

Therefore, "no" is the consistent and truthful answer. By saying "no," I'm correctly stating that my one-word answer is not a complete sentence.

## Final Answer

No
