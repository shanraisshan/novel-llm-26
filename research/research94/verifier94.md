## Consensus Analysis

### Summary of Reasoning
All five agents used the same systematic approach:

1. **Count 9s in the units place**: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99 = 10 occurrences
2. **Count 9s in the tens place**: 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 = 10 occurrences
3. **Note about 100**: The number 100 contains no 9s
4. **Total**: 10 + 10 = 20

All agents correctly noted that the number 99 contains two 9s (one in each position) and that both were counted separately in the respective categories.

### Areas of Agreement
- All 5 agents arrived at the answer of 20
- All agents used the same method of separating counts by digit position
- All agents correctly identified the same sets of numbers containing 9s
- All agents noted that 100 does not contribute to the count
