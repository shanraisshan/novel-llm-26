## Reasoning

To count how many times the digit 9 appears when writing the numbers from 1 to 100, I need to check each position where 9 can appear.

**Counting 9s in the units place (ones digit):**
- 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99
- Count: 10 occurrences

**Counting 9s in the tens place:**
- 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99
- Count: 10 occurrences

**The number 100:**
- Contains no 9s

**Total count:** 10 + 10 = 20

Note: The number 99 contains two 9s (one in the tens place and one in the units place), and both are counted separately in the respective categories above.

## Final Answer

20
