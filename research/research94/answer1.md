## Reasoning

To count how many times the digit 9 appears when writing numbers from 1 to 100, I need to consider each position where 9 can appear.

**Step 1: Count 9s in the units place (ones digit)**
The numbers with 9 in the units place are:
9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99

That gives us **10 occurrences** of the digit 9.

**Step 2: Count 9s in the tens place**
The numbers with 9 in the tens place are:
90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

That gives us **10 occurrences** of the digit 9.

**Step 3: Add them together**
- Units place: 10 nines
- Tens place: 10 nines
- Total: 10 + 10 = 20

Note: The number 99 contains two 9s, and I've correctly counted each one separately (one in the units place, one in the tens place).

The number 100 does not contain the digit 9, so it doesn't contribute to our count.

## Final Answer

**20**

The digit 9 is written 20 times when writing the numbers from 1 to 100.
