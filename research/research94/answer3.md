## Reasoning

To count how many times the digit 9 appears when writing numbers from 1 to 100, I need to check each position where 9 can appear.

**Counting 9s in the units place (ones digit):**
The digit 9 appears in the units place in these numbers:
9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99

That gives us **10 occurrences** in the units place.

**Counting 9s in the tens place:**
The digit 9 appears in the tens place in these numbers:
90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

That gives us **10 occurrences** in the tens place.

**Note about 100:**
The number 100 contains no 9s, so it doesn't add to our count.

**Total count:**
10 (units place) + 10 (tens place) = **20 times**

## Final Answer

20
