## Reasoning

This question presents the classic "river crossing puzzle" scenario with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage, but then asks a simple factual question about the wolf.

The puzzle context is essentially a distraction. The actual question being asked is straightforward: "How many legs does the wolf have?"

A wolf is a four-legged mammal (quadruped). Like dogs, foxes, and other canines, wolves have four legs.

## Final Answer

The wolf has 4 legs.
