## Reasoning

The question presents a classic river-crossing puzzle scenario involving a farmer, a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. However, the actual question being asked is not about solving the puzzle - it is simply asking how many legs the wolf has.

A wolf is a four-legged mammal (quadruped). This is a basic biological fact that does not depend on any puzzle context.

The river-crossing scenario is essentially a distraction or red herring designed to see if the reader will overcomplicate the problem.

## Final Answer

The wolf has 4 legs.
