# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
"A farmer needs to cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. How many legs does the wolf have?"

## Expected Answer
4

## Summary of Each Answer

### Answer 1
- **Core Conclusion**: The wolf has 4 legs.
- **Key Evidence**: A wolf is a four-legged mammal (quadruped). This is a basic biological fact.
- **Unique Insights**: Correctly identified that the river-crossing scenario is a distraction or red herring.

### Answer 2
- **Core Conclusion**: The wolf has 4 legs.
- **Key Evidence**: A wolf is a four-legged mammal (quadruped), like dogs, foxes, and other canines.
- **Unique Insights**: Noted the puzzle context is essentially a distraction from a straightforward question.

### Answer 3
- **Core Conclusion**: A wolf has 4 legs.
- **Key Evidence**: A wolf is a mammal in the canine family, and all such mammals have four legs.
- **Unique Insights**: Emphasized that the answer is independent of the river-crossing puzzle context.

### Answer 4
- **Core Conclusion**: The wolf has 4 legs.
- **Key Evidence**: A wolf is a four-legged mammal (a quadruped). Like all canines, wolves walk on four legs.
- **Unique Insights**: Clearly stated the river-crossing puzzle is a distraction from basic animal anatomy.

### Answer 5
- **Core Conclusion**: The wolf has 4 legs.
- **Key Evidence**: Wolves are quadrupeds, meaning they walk on four legs.
- **Unique Insights**: Concisely noted the puzzle context does not change the basic biological fact.

## Answer Comparison Table

| Answer # | Conclusion | Correct (Yes/No) |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| 1        | 4 legs     | Yes              |
| 2        | 4 legs     | Yes              |
| 3        | 4 legs     | Yes              |
| 4        | 4 legs     | Yes              |
| 5        | 4 legs     | Yes              |

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All five answers unanimously agree that:
1. The wolf has 4 legs
2. The river-crossing puzzle scenario is a distraction from the actual question
3. Wolves are quadrupeds (four-legged mammals)
4. This is a basic biological/anatomical fact

### Areas of Disagreement
There are no areas of disagreement among the five answers. All researchers arrived at the same conclusion through essentially identical reasoning.

### Quality Assessment
All five answers demonstrated strong reasoning by:
- Correctly identifying the question being asked (wolf leg count, not puzzle solution)
- Recognizing the puzzle context as a red herring
- Providing accurate biological information about wolves
- Giving clear, unambiguous final answers

## Final Synthesized Answer

The wolf has **4 legs**.

This is a straightforward factual question about basic animal anatomy. Wolves are quadrupeds - four-legged mammals belonging to the canine family. The classic river-crossing puzzle scenario presented in the question is entirely irrelevant to answering how many legs a wolf has. The puzzle context serves as a distraction, but the answer remains a simple biological fact: wolves, like all canines, have four legs.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score**: 100%
- **Reliability Notes**: This is a straightforward factual question with no room for interpretation. All five independent researchers arrived at the same correct answer with identical reasoning. The high confidence is fully justified.

## SCORE: 100%
