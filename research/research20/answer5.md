## Reasoning

The question presents the classic "river crossing puzzle" scenario with a farmer, wolf, goat, and cabbage. However, the actual question being asked is simply: "How many legs does the wolf have?"

This is a straightforward factual question about wolf anatomy. Wolves are quadrupeds, meaning they walk on four legs. The river crossing puzzle context is a distraction - it does not change the basic biological fact about wolves.

## Final Answer

The wolf has 4 legs.
