## Reasoning

This question presents the classic "farmer crossing the river" puzzle, but then asks a straightforward factual question about one of the elements in the puzzle.

The question asks: "How many legs does the wolf have?"

A wolf is a mammal, and like all mammals in the canine family, wolves have four legs. This is a basic biological fact that is independent of the river-crossing puzzle context.

The puzzle setup (farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage, river) is essentially a distraction. The actual question being asked is simply about the anatomy of a wolf.

## Final Answer

A wolf has 4 legs.
