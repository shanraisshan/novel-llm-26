## Reasoning

This question presents what appears to be a classic river-crossing puzzle (the wolf, goat, and cabbage problem), but then asks a completely different and straightforward question: how many legs does the wolf have?

The river-crossing puzzle context is a distraction. The actual question being asked is simply about basic animal anatomy.

A wolf is a four-legged mammal (a quadruped). Like all canines, wolves walk on four legs.

## Final Answer

The wolf has 4 legs.
