# Answer 3

## My Answer
2 kilograms of feathers is heavier than 2 pounds of bricks.

## My Reasoning
This is a unit conversion question. 1 kilogram equals approximately 2.2 pounds. Therefore, 2 kilograms of feathers weighs about 4.4 pounds, which is more than 2 pounds of bricks. The material (bricks vs feathers) is irrelevant here - what matters is the actual weight specified, and 2 kg is greater than 2 lbs.
