# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
"Does your answer to this question start with the letter 'y'? Answer yes or no."

## Correct Answer
Yes

## Summary of Each Answer

### Answer 1
- **Core Conclusion**: Yes
- **Key Evidence**: Direct answer without elaboration
- **Unique Insights**: None provided

### Answer 2
- **Core Conclusion**: Yes
- **Key Evidence**: Explicitly recognized the self-referential nature of the question
- **Unique Insights**: Noted that both "yes" and "no" can be self-consistently true - if you say "yes" it starts with 'y' making it true; if you say "no" it starts with 'n' (not 'y') also making it true. Chose "yes" as the straightforward self-fulfilling answer.

### Answer 3
- **Core Conclusion**: Yes
- **Key Evidence**: Direct answer without elaboration
- **Unique Insights**: None provided

### Answer 4
- **Core Conclusion**: Yes
- **Key Evidence**: Direct answer without elaboration
- **Unique Insights**: None provided

### Answer 5
- **Core Conclusion**: Yes
- **Key Evidence**: Direct answer without elaboration
- **Unique Insights**: None provided

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All 5 answers unanimously agree on "Yes" as the correct response. This represents complete consensus on the self-referential question.

### Areas of Disagreement
There are no areas of disagreement. All answers converge on the same conclusion.

### Quality Assessment
- **Answer 2** provided the strongest reasoning by explicitly analyzing the self-referential paradox nature of the question, recognizing that both answers could technically be self-consistent but choosing "yes" as the more straightforward self-fulfilling response.
- **Answers 1, 3, 4, and 5** gave correct but unexplained answers, demonstrating the ability to recognize the self-consistent solution without elaboration.

## Final Synthesized Answer

**Yes**

This is a self-referential question that creates a logical loop. The question asks whether the answer starts with 'y'. By answering "Yes," the response begins with the letter 'y', making the statement true and self-consistent.

Interestingly, as Answer 2 noted, this question has two logically consistent solutions:
1. "Yes" - starts with 'y', making the claim true (self-fulfilling)
2. "No" - starts with 'n' (not 'y'), making the claim true (also self-fulfilling)

However, "Yes" is the expected and more intuitive answer because it directly affirms the self-referential property in a positive way.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score**: 100%
- **Reliability Notes**: Perfect consensus. All agents correctly identified "Yes" as the answer. The self-referential nature of the question means "Yes" is a self-consistent and correct response. The question is a classic example of a self-referential statement where the answer validates itself.
