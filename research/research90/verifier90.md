## Reasoning Summary
All 5 answers arrived at the same conclusion through identical logical reasoning:
1. The question requires answering with either "yes" or "no"
2. Both "yes" and "no" are complete words in English
3. Answering "yes" is truthful and self-consistent (since "yes" is a complete word)
4. Answering "no" would be false and self-contradictory (since "no" is also a complete word, contradicting the claim)
5. Therefore, "yes" is the only logically consistent answer
