## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete word? Answer yes or no."

I must answer with either "yes" or "no". Let me analyze both options:

1. If I answer "yes" - "yes" is a complete word (a valid English word spelled Y-E-S). This would make my answer truthful, since I am indeed responding with a complete word.

2. If I answer "no" - "no" is also a complete word (a valid English word spelled N-O). But if I say "no," I would be claiming my answer is NOT a complete word, which would be false since "no" IS a complete word.

Therefore, "yes" is the logically consistent answer. By answering "yes," I am truthfully confirming that my answer is a complete word.

## Final Answer
Yes
