## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete word? Answer yes or no."

Let me analyze both possible answers:

1. If I answer "yes" - "yes" is a complete word (a valid English word with 3 letters)
2. If I answer "no" - "no" is also a complete word (a valid English word with 2 letters)

Since both allowed responses ("yes" and "no") are complete words, the truthful answer to whether my answer is a complete word would be "yes."

If I say "yes," then my answer ("yes") is indeed a complete word, making my response true and consistent.

## Final Answer

Yes
