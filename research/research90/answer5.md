## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete word? Answer yes or no."

This is a self-referential question where I must answer either "yes" or "no".

Let me analyze both possible answers:
1. If I answer "yes" - "yes" is a complete word, so the answer would be true and consistent
2. If I answer "no" - "no" is also a complete word, so the answer would be false and inconsistent

Since both "yes" and "no" are complete words, the truthful and consistent answer is "yes" - my answer is indeed a complete word.

## Final Answer
Yes
