## Reasoning
The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete word? Answer yes or no."

1. I must answer either "yes" or "no"
2. Both "yes" and "no" are complete words in English
3. If I answer "yes" - I am claiming my answer is a complete word. Since "yes" is indeed a complete word, this answer would be true and self-consistent.
4. If I answer "no" - I would be claiming my answer is NOT a complete word. But "no" IS a complete word, so this answer would be false and self-contradictory.

The only consistent answer is "yes" because it correctly describes itself as a complete word.

## Final Answer
Yes
