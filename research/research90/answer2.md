## Reasoning

The question asks: "Is your answer to this question a complete word? Answer yes or no."

Let me analyze this:

1. I must answer either "yes" or "no"
2. Both "yes" and "no" are complete words in English
3. If I answer "yes" - is "yes" a complete word? Yes, it is. This makes the answer consistent and correct.
4. If I answer "no" - is "no" a complete word? Yes, it is. This would make the answer self-contradictory (claiming my answer is not a complete word when "no" is in fact a complete word).
5. Therefore, the only consistent answer is "yes" - because "yes" is indeed a complete word.

## Final Answer

Yes
