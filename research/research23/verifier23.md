## Question
What whole number is both greater than 3 and less than 4?

## Correct Answer
There is no such number / None / No whole number exists between 3 and 4

## Individual Answers
| Agent | Answer | Correct? |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | There is no whole number between 3 and 4. Whole numbers are integers, and no integer exists between 3 and 4. | Yes |
| 2 | There is no whole number between 3 and 4. No integer exists between 3 and 4. | Yes |
| 3 | There is no whole number between 3 and 4. Whole numbers are integers, and there are no integers between 3 and 4. | Yes |
| 4 | There is no whole number between 3 and 4. The whole numbers go 3, 4, 5, etc., with no whole number between 3 and 4. | Yes |
| 5 | There is no whole number between 3 and 4. Whole numbers are integers, and there are no integers between 3 and 4. | Yes |

## Consensus Score
100% (5/5 correct)

## Analysis
All five agents correctly identified that no whole number exists between 3 and 4. Each agent provided sound reasoning, noting that whole numbers (integers) are discrete values with no integer lying strictly between 3 and 4. The agents demonstrated consistent understanding of the mathematical properties of whole numbers. This question tests recognition of the discrete nature of integers versus continuous number systems like real numbers. The unanimous consensus indicates high reliability of the answer.
