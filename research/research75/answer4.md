## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. Water is a liquid, and liquids are subject to gravity. Gravity pulls water straight down toward the center of the Earth.

2. When water is at rest in any container, it settles into a state where its surface is perpendicular to the direction of gravitational pull. This means the surface becomes horizontal - parallel to the ground.

3. The shape or orientation of the container does not change the direction gravity acts on the water. Gravity always points straight down, regardless of how the glass is tilted.

4. If you tilt a glass 45 degrees, the glass itself rotates, but the water inside will redistribute so that its surface remains horizontal (parallel to the ground). The water will shift toward the lower side of the tilted glass.

5. This is why when you tilt a glass, water can spill out one side - because the water level stays horizontal while the glass rim on the lower side dips below the water surface.

6. The bottom of the glass, now at a 45-degree angle, is no longer parallel to the water surface. The water surface remains level with respect to the Earth.

## Final Answer

The water surface stays parallel to the ground, not parallel to the bottom of the glass. Gravity acts on the water independently of the container's orientation, so the water surface always remains horizontal (level with the Earth's surface) regardless of how the glass is tilted.
