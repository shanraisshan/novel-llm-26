## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. **What determines the orientation of a water surface?** Water, like all liquids, is subject to gravity. Gravity pulls the water downward toward the center of the Earth.

2. **How does water behave in a container?** When water is at rest in any container, it seeks the lowest possible position due to gravity. The surface of the water will always orient itself perpendicular to the direction of gravitational pull.

3. **What happens when you tilt the glass?** When you tilt a glass 45 degrees, the glass itself rotates, but gravity does not change direction. Gravity still points straight down toward the ground.

4. **Does the water follow the glass or follow gravity?** The water follows gravity, not the glass. Since gravity pulls straight down, the water surface must remain horizontal (perpendicular to the gravitational force).

5. **Conclusion:** The water surface remains parallel to the ground (horizontal), regardless of how you tilt the glass. The bottom of the glass is now at a 45-degree angle to the ground, but the water surface stays level with the ground.

This is the same principle that allows us to use water levels as tools for determining horizontal - water always finds its own level relative to gravity, not relative to its container.

## Final Answer

The water surface stays **parallel to the ground**, not parallel to the bottom of the glass. When you tilt a glass 45 degrees, gravity continues to act vertically downward, so the water surface remains horizontal (level with the ground) while the glass tilts around it.
