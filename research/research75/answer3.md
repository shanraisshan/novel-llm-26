## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. **What determines the orientation of a water surface?** Water, like all liquids, is subject to gravity. Gravity always pulls straight down toward the center of the Earth.

2. **How does water behave in a container?** Water settles to find its lowest potential energy state. This means the surface becomes perpendicular to the gravitational force acting on it.

3. **What happens when you tilt the glass?** When you tilt a glass 45 degrees, the glass itself rotates, but gravity does not change direction. Gravity still points straight down toward the ground.

4. **Does the water follow the glass or follow gravity?** The water follows gravity. It will redistribute itself within the tilted glass so that its surface remains horizontal relative to the ground (perpendicular to the gravitational pull).

5. **Visual confirmation:** If you actually perform this experiment, you will see that when you tilt a glass, the water level rises on one side and drops on the other, but the water surface itself stays level with respect to the horizon/ground - not with respect to the bottom of the glass.

## Final Answer

The water surface stays parallel to the ground, not parallel to the bottom of the glass. This is because gravity determines the orientation of a liquid's surface, and gravity always points toward the Earth regardless of how the container is oriented. The water surface will always settle perpendicular to the gravitational force, which means it remains horizontal (parallel to the ground) even when the glass is tilted.
