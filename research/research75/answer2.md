## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. Water is a liquid, and liquids naturally settle under the influence of gravity.

2. Gravity always pulls straight down toward the center of the Earth, regardless of the orientation of any container.

3. The surface of water at rest will always be perpendicular to the direction of gravitational force. This means the water surface will be horizontal relative to the Earth.

4. When you tilt a glass 45 degrees, the bottom of the glass is no longer horizontal - it's now at a 45-degree angle to the ground.

5. However, the water inside doesn't "know" or "care" about the orientation of the glass. It only responds to gravity.

6. Therefore, the water will redistribute itself within the tilted glass, but its surface will remain horizontal (parallel to the ground), not parallel to the tilted bottom of the glass.

7. This is why when you tilt a glass of water, the water level rises on one side and falls on the other - the water is maintaining its horizontal surface while the container changes orientation around it.

## Final Answer

The water surface stays parallel to the ground, not parallel to the bottom of the glass. Gravity determines the orientation of a liquid's surface, and since gravity pulls straight down regardless of how the container is tilted, the water surface remains horizontal (parallel to the Earth's surface). This is a fundamental property of liquids at rest - they always form a level surface perpendicular to the gravitational force acting on them.
