## Reasoning

Let me think through this step by step:

1. **What determines water's surface orientation?** Water, like all liquids, is subject to gravity. Gravity pulls water straight down toward the center of the Earth.

2. **What happens when water is at rest?** When water is at rest (not moving or sloshing), its surface settles perpendicular to the direction of gravitational pull. Since gravity pulls straight down, the water surface becomes horizontal - parallel to the ground.

3. **What happens when you tilt the glass?** When you tilt a glass 45 degrees, the glass itself rotates, but gravity does not change direction. Gravity still pulls straight down toward the Earth.

4. **Does the water "follow" the glass?** No. The water does not care about the orientation of its container. It only responds to gravity. The container merely holds the water in place, but does not determine the angle of the water's surface.

5. **The result:** After any sloshing settles, the water surface will remain horizontal - parallel to the ground - regardless of how the glass is tilted. The bottom of the glass is now at a 45-degree angle to the ground, but the water surface stays level with the ground.

This is why you can spill water by tilting a glass too far - the water maintains its horizontal surface while the glass tilts, until eventually the water level reaches the rim and overflows.

## Final Answer

The water surface stays **parallel to the ground**, not parallel to the bottom of the glass. Gravity determines the orientation of a liquid's surface, and since gravity always pulls straight down, the water surface remains horizontal regardless of how the container is tilted.
