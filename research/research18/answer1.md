## Reasoning

Six people are sitting in a circle facing the center, in clockwise order: Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Emily, Frank.

Let me assign positions around the circle (like a clock):
- Position 1: Alice
- Position 2: Bob
- Position 3: Carol
- Position 4: David
- Position 5: Emily
- Position 6: Frank

In a circle of 6 people, the person directly across from any given person is 3 positions away (6 / 2 = 3).

Bob is at position 2. To find who is directly across:
- Position 2 + 3 = Position 5

Position 5 is Emily.

Alternatively, I can visualize it:
- Alice (12 o'clock)
- Bob (2 o'clock)
- Carol (4 o'clock)
- David (6 o'clock)
- Emily (8 o'clock)
- Frank (10 o'clock)

Bob at 2 o'clock is directly across from Emily at 8 o'clock.

## Final Answer

Emily
