## Reasoning

Six people sit in a circle in clockwise order: Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Emily, Frank.

Let me assign positions 1-6 around the circle (clockwise):
- Position 1: Alice
- Position 2: Bob
- Position 3: Carol
- Position 4: David
- Position 5: Emily
- Position 6: Frank

In a circle of 6 people, the person directly across from any given person is 3 positions away (since 6/2 = 3).

Bob is at position 2. To find who is directly across:
- Position 2 + 3 = Position 5

Position 5 is Emily.

## Final Answer
Emily
