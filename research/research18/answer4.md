## Reasoning

Six people sit in a circle in clockwise order: Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Emily, Frank.

Let me assign positions around the circle (like a clock face with 6 positions):
- Position 1: Alice
- Position 2: Bob
- Position 3: Carol
- Position 4: David
- Position 5: Emily
- Position 6: Frank

In a circle of 6 people, the person directly across from any given person is 3 positions away (since 6/2 = 3).

Bob is at position 2. Moving 3 positions clockwise from Bob:
- Position 2 (Bob) -> Position 3 -> Position 4 -> Position 5

Position 5 is Emily.

Alternatively, counting 3 positions counterclockwise from Bob:
- Position 2 (Bob) -> Position 1 -> Position 6 -> Position 5

Either way, position 5 (Emily) is directly across from position 2 (Bob).

## Final Answer

Emily
