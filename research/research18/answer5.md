## Reasoning

Six people sit in a circle in clockwise order: Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Emily, Frank.

Let me assign positions 1-6 around the circle:
- Position 1: Alice
- Position 2: Bob
- Position 3: Carol
- Position 4: David
- Position 5: Emily
- Position 6: Frank

In a circle of 6 people, the person directly across from any position is 3 positions away (since 6/2 = 3).

Bob is at position 2. The person directly across from Bob is at position 2 + 3 = position 5.

Position 5 is Emily.

## Final Answer

Emily
