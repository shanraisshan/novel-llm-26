# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
"Six people sit in a circle facing the center: Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Emily, Frank (in that clockwise order). Who is sitting directly across from Bob?"

## Expected Answer
Emily

## Summary of Each Answer

### Answer 1
- **Core Conclusion**: Emily
- **Key Evidence**: Assigned positions 1-6 clockwise. Bob at position 2. In a circle of 6, the person across is 3 positions away (6/2=3). Position 2 + 3 = Position 5 = Emily. Also verified with clock visualization (Bob at 2 o'clock, Emily at 8 o'clock).
- **Unique Insights**: Provided a helpful clock-face analogy for visualization.

### Answer 2
- **Core Conclusion**: Emily
- **Key Evidence**: Assigned positions 1-6 clockwise. Bob at position 2. Person across is 3 positions away (6/2=3). Position 2 + 3 = Position 5 = Emily.
- **Unique Insights**: Concise and straightforward reasoning.

### Answer 3
- **Core Conclusion**: Emily
- **Key Evidence**: Assigned positions 1-6 clockwise. Bob at position 2. Person directly across is 3 positions away (6/2=3). Position 2 + 3 = Position 5 = Emily.
- **Unique Insights**: Clear step-by-step calculation.

### Answer 4
- **Core Conclusion**: Emily
- **Key Evidence**: Assigned positions 1-6 clockwise. Bob at position 2. Moved 3 positions from Bob to find position 5 = Emily. Verified by counting both clockwise and counterclockwise.
- **Unique Insights**: Demonstrated the solution works in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise).

### Answer 5
- **Core Conclusion**: Emily
- **Key Evidence**: Assigned positions 1-6 clockwise. Bob at position 2. Person across is 3 positions away (6/2=3). Position 2 + 3 = Position 5 = Emily.
- **Unique Insights**: Clear and direct reasoning.

## Results Table

| Answer # | Conclusion | Correct (Yes/No) |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| 1        | Emily      | Yes              |
| 2        | Emily      | Yes              |
| 3        | Emily      | Yes              |
| 4        | Emily      | Yes              |
| 5        | Emily      | Yes              |

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All five answers unanimously agree that Emily is sitting directly across from Bob. Every answer used the same fundamental approach:
1. Assigned positions 1-6 to the six people in clockwise order
2. Identified Bob at position 2
3. Applied the principle that in a circle of 6, the person across is 3 positions away
4. Calculated position 2 + 3 = position 5 = Emily

### Areas of Disagreement
None. All answers reached the same conclusion using consistent methodology.

### Quality Assessment
All five answers demonstrated strong reasoning with clear mathematical justification. Answer 1 and Answer 4 provided additional verification methods (clock-face analogy and bidirectional counting, respectively), showing extra thoroughness.

## Final Synthesized Answer

**Emily** is sitting directly across from Bob.

In a circle of 6 people arranged clockwise as Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Emily, Frank, each person's position across is exactly 3 seats away (half the circle). Bob is in the 2nd position, and counting 3 positions forward brings us to position 5, which is Emily.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Consensus Level**: 5/5 answers agree on the core conclusion
- **Confidence Score**: 100%
- **Reliability Notes**: This is a straightforward geometric problem with a definitive answer. All five independent answers used correct mathematical reasoning and arrived at the same conclusion. There is no uncertainty in this result.

## SCORE: 100%
