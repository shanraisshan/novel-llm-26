# Verifier Analysis

## Original Question
"I have five fingers on my left hand and five fingers on my right hand. How many fingers do I have that are not on my hands?"

## Correct Answer
Zero (0)

## Summary of Each Answer

### Answer 1
- **Final Answer**: 0 (zero)
- **Correct**: Yes
- **Key Reasoning**: Fingers are specifically the digits on hands. All 10 fingers (5 on each hand) are on the hands, so there are zero fingers not on the hands.

### Answer 2
- **Final Answer**: 0 (zero)
- **Correct**: Yes
- **Key Reasoning**: By definition, fingers are digits on hands. All of a person's fingers are located on their hands. There are no fingers that exist elsewhere on the body.

### Answer 3
- **Final Answer**: 0 (zero)
- **Correct**: Yes
- **Key Reasoning**: Fingers, by definition, are digits that are located on hands. If something is a finger, it is on a hand. Therefore, there cannot be any fingers that are "not on my hands."

### Answer 4
- **Final Answer**: 0 (zero)
- **Correct**: Yes
- **Key Reasoning**: All fingers are on hands (that's what makes them fingers). The question is a trick designed to see if someone will add 5 + 5 = 10, but the correct answer is zero.

### Answer 5
- **Final Answer**: 0 (zero)
- **Correct**: Yes
- **Key Reasoning**: By definition, fingers are the digits on hands. Since all of a person's fingers are located on their hands, the answer is zero.

## Consensus Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
All 5 answers agree on the following points:
1. The final answer is 0 (zero)
2. Fingers are, by definition, digits located on hands
3. This is a trick question designed to mislead
4. Toes are not fingers and should not be counted

### Areas of Disagreement
None. All answers are in complete agreement on both the final answer and the reasoning behind it.

### Quality Assessment
All 5 answers demonstrated strong reasoning by:
- Identifying this as a trick question
- Applying the definitional logic that fingers are only on hands
- Arriving at the correct answer of zero

## Final Synthesized Answer

The answer is **0 (zero)**.

The question asks how many fingers you have that are NOT on your hands. Since fingers are, by definition, the digits located on hands, all of your fingers are on your hands. You cannot have fingers that are not on your hands because that would be a contradiction in terms. Therefore, the number of fingers not on your hands is zero.
