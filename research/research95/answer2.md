## Reasoning

Let me analyze this question carefully:

1. The question states: "I have five fingers on my left hand and five fingers on my right hand."
2. The question asks: "How many fingers do I have that are not on my hands?"

This is a trick question that plays on assumptions. Let me think through it:

- The person has 5 fingers on their left hand
- The person has 5 fingers on their right hand
- That accounts for all fingers on their hands (10 total on hands)

The question asks how many fingers they have that are NOT on their hands.

By definition, fingers are digits on hands. All of a person's fingers are located on their hands. There are no fingers that exist elsewhere on the body that are not on hands.

Therefore, the number of fingers not on their hands is zero.

## Final Answer

0 (zero)

All fingers are, by definition, on your hands. You cannot have fingers that are not on your hands, so the answer is zero.
