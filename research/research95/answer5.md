## Reasoning

Let me analyze this question carefully:

1. The question states: "I have five fingers on my left hand and five fingers on my right hand."
2. The question asks: "How many fingers do I have that are not on my hands?"

This is a straightforward logical question. The question is asking about fingers that are NOT on my hands.

By definition, fingers are the digits on hands. If we're talking about "my fingers," those would be the digits on my hands. The question establishes that all my fingers (five on the left hand, five on the right hand) are on my hands.

Fingers that are "not on my hands" would mean fingers that exist somewhere other than on my hands. Since all of a person's fingers are located on their hands, the answer is zero.

Note: Some might try to interpret this as a trick question involving toes or other body parts, but toes are not fingers - they are toes. The question specifically asks about fingers.

## Final Answer

0 (zero)

All fingers are, by definition, on hands. Therefore, the number of fingers not on my hands is zero.
