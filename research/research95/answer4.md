## Reasoning

Let me analyze this question carefully:

1. The question states: "I have five fingers on my left hand and five fingers on my right hand."
2. The question asks: "How many fingers do I have that are not on my hands?"

The key insight here is that fingers, by definition, are located on hands. The question is asking about fingers that are NOT on hands.

Since all fingers are on hands (that's what makes them fingers - they are digits attached to hands), there are no fingers that exist "not on my hands."

This appears to be a trick question designed to see if someone will add 5 + 5 = 10, but the question is actually asking about fingers that are NOT on hands, which would be zero.

## Final Answer

0 (zero)

All fingers are, by definition, on hands. Therefore, there are no fingers that are "not on my hands."
