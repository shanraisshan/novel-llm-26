## Reasoning

Let me analyze this question carefully:

1. The question states: "I have five fingers on my left hand and five fingers on my right hand."
2. The question asks: "How many fingers do I have that are not on my hands?"

This is a straightforward logic question. The key insight is:

- Fingers, by definition, are digits that are located on hands.
- If something is a finger, it is on a hand.
- Therefore, there cannot be any fingers that are "not on my hands" because all fingers are, by definition, on hands.

The question might be trying to trick someone into doing arithmetic (like 10 total fingers minus something), but the literal answer is simple: you cannot have fingers that are not on your hands.

## Final Answer

0 (zero)

You have zero fingers that are not on your hands. All fingers are on hands by definition - a finger that is not on a hand would not be called a finger.
