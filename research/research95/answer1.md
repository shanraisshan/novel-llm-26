## Reasoning

Let me analyze this question carefully:

1. The question states: "I have five fingers on my left hand and five fingers on my right hand."
2. The question asks: "How many fingers do I have that are not on my hands?"

This is a trick question that plays on the ambiguity of the word "fingers."

The key insight is that the question asks about fingers that are NOT on the hands. By definition, fingers are the digits on hands. If we're talking about digits that are not on hands, those would be toes (which are on feet).

However, the most straightforward interpretation is:
- Fingers are specifically the digits on hands
- If all your fingers are on your hands (5 on left + 5 on right = 10 total fingers on hands)
- Then the number of fingers NOT on your hands = 0

Some might argue about toes, but toes are not called "fingers" - they are toes. Fingers specifically refer to digits on hands.

## Final Answer

0 (zero)

All fingers, by definition, are on your hands. You cannot have fingers that are not on your hands because fingers are the digits of the hand. The 10 fingers you have (5 on each hand) are all on your hands, so there are zero fingers that are not on your hands.
