## Reasoning
The word "BIRD" has 4 letters: B-I-R-D (positions 1, 2, 3, 4).

For a word with an even number of letters, there is no single middle letter. The middle positions would be positions 2 and 3, which correspond to the letters "I" and "R".

If forced to identify middle letters, they would be "I" and "R". However, since the question asks for "the middle letter" (singular), this question doesn't have a precise answer for a 4-letter word.

## Final Answer
The word "BIRD" has 4 letters, so there is no single middle letter. The two middle letters are "I" and "R".
