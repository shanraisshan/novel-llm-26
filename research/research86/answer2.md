## Reasoning
The word "BIRD" has 4 letters: B-I-R-D (positions 1, 2, 3, 4).

Since the word has an even number of letters (4), there is no single middle letter. Instead, there are two middle letters at positions 2 and 3, which are "I" and "R".

If forced to identify a "middle letter," the two middle letters are I and R.

## Final Answer
The word "BIRD" has 4 letters, so there is no single middle letter. The two middle letters are "I" and "R".
