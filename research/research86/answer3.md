## Reasoning
The word "BIRD" has 4 letters: B-I-R-D (positions 1-2-3-4).

Since the word has an even number of letters (4), there is no single middle letter. Instead, there are two middle letters: "I" at position 2 and "R" at position 3.

If forced to identify "the middle letter" for a 4-letter word, one could argue either:
- The two middle letters are "I" and "R"
- Or if we must pick one, conventionally the letter at position (n/2) = position 2, which is "I"

## Final Answer
The word "BIRD" has no single middle letter because it contains an even number of letters (4). The two middle letters are "I" and "R".
