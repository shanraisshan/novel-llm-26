## Reasoning
The word "BIRD" has 4 letters: B-I-R-D

To find the middle letter, I need to identify the center position(s):
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: D

Since "BIRD" has an even number of letters (4), there is no single middle letter. Instead, there are two middle letters: I (position 2) and R (position 3).

If forced to choose one, the middle letters are I and R.

## Final Answer
The word "BIRD" has 4 letters, so there is no single middle letter. The two middle letters are I and R.
