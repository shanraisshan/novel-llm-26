An automated infinite loop research workflow that generates questions designed to **break modern LLMs**. The goal is to find simple, generic questions that any human can easily answer, but cause AI models to disagree.

## The Goal

Create questions like the famous **"strawberry problem"** — simple one-liners that:
- A 5-year-old can answer correctly
- Frontier LLMs (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini) consistently fail or disagree on
- Achieve **< 10% consensus** among 5 independent AI researchers

## The Winning Question

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/winning-question.svg" alt="The Winning Question" width="800">
</p>

After **103 research iterations**, we found it — a simple riddle that achieved **0% consensus** among 5 independent LLM researchers:

> **"I follow you everywhere but I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun. What am I?"**

**Why it breaks LLMs:**
- LLMs pattern-match to the classic "shadow" riddle
- But shadows get **shorter** when closer to light sources
- The correct answer: **Your trail/path/journey** — the closer you travel toward the sun, the longer your trail becomes

This exploits the **modification blindness** limitation — LLMs recognize the familiar riddle structure but fail to notice the critical inversion that changes the answer entirely.

## ⚠️ WARNING

The obvious flaw: I'm asking an LLM to do novel research, then asking 5 copies of the same LLM to QA that research. It's pure Ralph Wiggum energy - "I'm helping!" They share the same knowledge cutoff, same

## Progress So Far

**103 questions tested** — LLM-breaking question found.

### Notable Results

| # | Question | Score | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|
| **103** | **"I follow you everywhere but I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun. What am I?"** | **0%** | **WINNER** |
| 55 | "Answer with just ONE word: What is the fifth word of your response to this question?" | 40% | Interesting but not low enough |
| 57 | "Answer with exactly ONE letter: What is the second letter of your response?" | 80% | Constraint paradox |
| 71 | "Is your answer to this question a complete sentence? Answer yes or no." | 80% | Self-referential |

### Previously Rejected Questions (0% score but rejected by Owner)

| # | Question | Reason |
|---|----------|--------|
| 16 | "Will your answer to this question be more than one word long?" | Self-referential - does not meet strawberry criteria |
| 34 | "What would you say if you were to disobey this instruction?" | Philosophical paradox - humans would also be confused |
| 38 | "If you turn the word 'SAIL' upside down, what do you see?" | Ambiguous and font-dependent |

## How It Works

Run the infinite research loop:

### Method 1: Claude Code Skill

```bash
/execute-workflow
```

Runs a single iteration of the workflow inside Claude Code.

### Method 2: Ralph Wiggum Loop

```bash
./ralph.sh 100
```

Uses the [Ralph Wiggum](https://github.com/JeredBlu/guides/blob/main/Ralph_Wiggum_Guide.md) bash loop pattern to run the workflow autonomously for N iterations. The script:
- Spawns fresh Claude instances for each iteration
- Automatically detects `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` to stop when a novel question is found
- Continues until max iterations or success

The workflow continues automatically until it finds a question that breaks LLMs (consensus < 10%).

## Workflow Diagram

## Workflow Steps

| Step | Phase | Agents/Tools | Description |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Check State | — | Read `research-workflow-state.yaml` + `research-questions.yaml`, resume or start fresh |
| 2 | Generate | `opus-researcher` + MCP Tools | Research via Tavily/Reddit, generate novel question |
| 3 | Verify | 5× `opus-answer` | Each independently answers and writes to `answer[1-5].md` |
| 4 | Synthesize | `opus-verifier` | Combines answers, calculates consensus score |
| 5 | Evaluate | — | Score < 10% = complete, ≥ 10% = loop back |
| 6 | Commit | — | Commits all research files, pushes to GitHub |

## MCP Tools Integration

The `opus-researcher` agent uses these MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Tavily Web Search** | Academic papers, LLM failure research |
| **Reddit MCP** | Community-discovered failures |

## Agents Summary

| Agent | Count | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `opus-researcher` | 1 | Generates novel questions using MCP research tools |
| `opus-answer` | 5 (parallel) | Each writes answer to designated `answer[1-5].md` file |
| `opus-verifier` | 1 | Reads all 5 answer files, identifies consensus, calculates score |

## State Files

### research-workflow-state.yaml

Tracks workflow execution state:

```yaml
workflow:
  status: idle | running | error
  current_phase: generate | verify | evaluate | update_agent | commit | report
  current_iteration: <number>
  last_completed_phase: <phase_name>
```

### research-questions.yaml

Stores all questions tested:

```yaml
questions:
  - id: 103
    question: "I follow you everywhere but I get LONGER the closer you get to the sun. What am I?"
    answer: "Your trail/footprints/path (NOT a shadow - shadows get shorter near light sources)"
    status: completed
    folder: research103
    score: 0
    research_status: complete
    started_at: "02/02/2026 05:50 AM PST"
    completed_at: "02/02/2026 05:56 AM PST"
```

### research-status.json

Quick-access status:

```json
{
  "status": "complete"
}
```

## Why This Works

LLMs have fundamental limitations:

| Limitation | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Tokenization Blindness** | LLMs see tokens, not characters | "strawberry" → can't count 'r's |
| **Semantic Priming** | Word meaning overrides task | "ELEVEN" activates 11, not letter count 6 |
| **Pattern Matching** | Predict what answers look like | Novel computations fail |
| **Relational Logic** | Complex sibling/family relationships | "Each brother has 2 sisters" traps |
| **Modification Blindness** | Pattern-match to famous puzzles | **Our winner: "shadow" riddle with inverted logic** |

---

**Result**: Found the next "strawberry problem" — Research #103's riddle exposes modification blindness in frontier LLMs.
